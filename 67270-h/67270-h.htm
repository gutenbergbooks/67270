</div>


<p>Rear-Admiral French Ensor Chadwick was
born at Morgantown, W. Va., February 29,
1844. He was appointed to the U. S. Naval
Academy from West Virginia (then part of
Virginia) in 1861, and graduated in November,
1864. In the summer of 1864 he was attached
to the <i>Marblehead</i> in pursuit of the Confederate
steamers <i>Florida</i> and <i>Tallahassee</i>. After the
Civil War he served successively in a number
of vessels, and was promoted to the rank of
Lieutenant-Commander in 1869; was instructor
at the Naval Academy; on sea service, and
on lighthouse duty (1870-1882); Naval Attach&eacute;
at the American Embassy in London (1882-1889);
commanded the <i>Yorktown</i> (1889-1891);
was Chief Intelligence Officer (1892-1893); and
Chief of the Bureau of Equipment (1893-1897).</p>

<p>During the war with Spain he was Admiral
Sampson&#8217;s Chief of Staff, and also commanded
the flagship <i>New York</i>. He participated in all
the more important engagements in the Atlantic
during the war; was advanced five numbers
in rank for conspicuous conduct in battle, and
was presented with a sword of honor by citizens
of his native state.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>From 1900 to 1903 he was President of the
Naval War College at Newport; was promoted
Rear-Admiral October 11, 1903, and in 1904
became commander-in-chief of the South Atlantic
squadron. He retired February 28, 1906.</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Chadwick is one of the most
influential friends of the United States navy; he
has written extensively on diplomatic and naval
topics, and is the author of &#8220;Causes of the
Civil War&#8221; in the &#8220;American Nation Series.&#8221;
He is also much interested in problems of
municipal government, is a member of the
Newport Representative Council, a member of
the National Institute of Arts and Letters, corresponding
member of the Massachusetts Historical
Society, member of the American
Historical Association, etc.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> navy in all countries has ever been, and,
as far as we can now judge, ever will be, a
pre&euml;minent instrument of government. It was
through her navy that Greece destroyed the
power of Persia; Rome that of Carthage; the
allies at Lepanto that of the Turks; England
that of Holland and later that of France in
America; the navy of France, in turn, caused the
relinquishment of Great Britain&#8217;s sovereignty
over the thirteen colonies which formed the
United States, and a generation later it was the
British navy which made the efforts of the
great Napoleon the &#8220;baseless fabric of a vision.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coming to days within the ken of many still
living, the navy was the power which made
possible the preservation of the Union in our
great Civil War by the cutting off of the Southern
Confederacy from its means of support by
sea and reducing its forces thereby to practical
inanition. For had the Confederacy had free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
access to the sea and control of the Mississippi
River, no armies of the North could have conquered
well-supplied armies of the South. So,
too, the control of the sea decided the outcome
of the Spanish War. When Sampson&#8217;s fleet
destroyed Spain&#8217;s only battle squadron off
Santiago de Cuba, Spain could no longer reinforce
her army in Cuba, and surrender was a
necessity. Even as this is written Germany&#8217;s
every sea outlet is closed by the British fleet,
so superior in number to the German, and German
commerce on the sea is for the time entirely
swept away, leaving Great Britain for
the moment navally and commercially supreme
upon the ocean. As one attempts to look into
the future the vastness of the possible changes
startles the imagination, but in it all is ever
present the power that goes with the ubiquitous
warship, from whose threat no port of the world
is free. Military power fades to insignificance,
through its narrow limits of mobility, when compared
with the meaning of a great fleet. The
present sketch of history is to show what the
warship has done for us.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Great Britain attempted to reduce to
obedience the rebellious colonies which were to
form the United States of America she was dealing
with a people who in the North at least had
long been conversant with the building and sailing
of ships. A New England built ship entered
the Thames in 1638, only eighteen years
after the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth,
Massachusetts. The New England men, with a
sterile coast, with limitless fishing grounds and
unsurpassed harbors, turned as naturally to the
sea for livelihood as did the South, more kindly
treated by nature, to agriculture. In 1670 it
was estimated that two thirds of the British
shipping was employed in the American trade.
The Dutch, who had been great carriers on the
sea, were excluded from this trade by the navigation
laws of the period. Scotland was not
admitted to the trade of the American plantations
until her union with England in 1707, and
Ireland not until 1780, while in 1670 nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
could be imported into the American colonies
but what was laden in England in English-built
ships. But while none of their products could
be carried anywhere (except to other of the
plantations) till they were first landed in England,
the ships built in America were reckoned
as English, and this fact gave great impetus
to American shipbuilding. American shipping
prospered amazingly. But while thus prospering,
it was the attempted repression of our
commerce afloat and ashore (which included
such things as forbidding the exportation of
hats, restricting the manufacture of iron, and
forbidding commerce with the foreign-owned
islands of the West Indies) which did much
more to develop the idea of independence than
did the Stamp Act. But the net result of conditions
was to foster shipping, and our competition
had so increased by 1725 that in that year
&#8220;the shipwrights of the river Thames came up
to Whitehall with a complaint that their business
had declined and their workmen emigrated
because the plantations furnished England with
ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the register of the underwriters at Lloyd&#8217;s
for 1775, comprehending the shipping of the
three preceding years, there were 3,908 British-built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
vessels of 605,545 tons, and 2,311 of
American build with a tonnage of 373,618 tons.
The average size of the ship of the time was
about 400 tons displacement. One 100 feet in
length and 26 to 28 feet broad was a good-sized
ship. They were but cockle boats in comparison
with the vast ships of to-day, many of which
are full a hundred times 400 tons displacement.</p>

<p>The foregoing will show that when there came
a time to dispute the sea with Great Britain
there was no difficulty in supplying the ships,
and the many ironworks which had been established,
particularly in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania,
despite Great Britain&#8217;s restrictions,
could furnish guns in the manufacture of which
our foundries were adepts before the war.</p>

<p>The larger men-of-war of the period were
greater in size than the largest merchantmen.
The greater ships-of-the-line (by which expression
is meant those which could take their
place in the line of battle, the formation of which
was in a single extended column) varied from
4,000 to 3,000 tons displacement. The larger
of these, which carried guns on three main decks
and some light guns on the upper deck, to the
number altogether of 100, or even 120, were 180<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
to 190 feet on the gun deck, with about 53 feet
beam. The most usual size, however, was the
&#8220;74,&#8221; carrying nominally that number of guns,
but usually six or eight more, on two main decks
(and thus known as a two-decker). This class
was about 168 feet long on the gun deck and 47
feet broad. Below this class there were many
ships of sixty, fifty, or even forty-four guns, with
two gun decks. Such, for a long period, formed
part of the line of battle.</p>

<p>The frigates had but one covered gun deck.
They varied in length from 115 to 130 feet on
the gun deck, and were from 32 to 36 feet beam,
roughly a fourth of their length. They formed
no part of a line of battle, their duty when accompanying
a fleet being to remain clear of the
line and repeat the admiral&#8217;s signals. There
was also a small class of ship called a sloop-of-war,
which carried guns on only the upper, or
spar, deck as it came to be called. These vessels
were ship-rigged; that is, they had three masts
with square sails on each. They were usually
about 100 feet long and about 27 feet beam.</p>

<p>The three-deckers, or 100-gun ships, carried
about 900 men; the 74&#8217;s about 600; the frigates
about 160. The guns of the period were of
course all smooth-bores and muzzle-loaders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
In the large ships, the heavier guns, usually 32-pounders,
were carried on the lower gun decks
to give stability to the ship; 18&#8217;s or 24&#8217;s were
carried on the middle deck, 9&#8217;s and 12&#8217;s on the
upper, 9&#8217;s and 6&#8217;s on the quarter deck, which
was the part of the upper deck aft of the mainmast,
and on the forecastle, which was the part
of the upper deck forward of the foremast; the
space between the two was called the waist.
The larger frigates usually carried 18&#8217;s on the
gun deck; the smaller, 12&#8217;s or 9&#8217;s. The sloops
carried 9&#8217;s or 6&#8217;s. The greatest range of even
the heavier guns was but little over 2,000 yards,
as the ports rarely allowed more than 8&deg; or 9&deg;
elevation. Such guns were but toys compared
with modern ordnance, but they were common
alike to all nations, and all were thus on the
same footing.</p>

<p>An immense difference between that day and
this was in the motive power which then and
for two and a half generations later consisted of
lofty wooden masts, reaching skyward in the
greater ships about 200 feet, crossed by &#8220;yards,&#8221;
the larger of which were about 100 feet long, the
former supported by a great mass of rigging
known as shrouds and stays, the latter moved
by &#8220;braces&#8221; and the sails worked by a maze of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
running rigging. All this, of course, was subject
to being shot away, and ships were thus
frequently completely dismasted or disabled
in action. The same result was often, too, produced
by a gale of wind, it being no uncommon
thing for a fleet to be thus completely incapacitated
for the continuance of a voyage.</p>

<p>Weeks or fortnights were spent in a voyage
now done in days. Of certainty as to time of
reaching port, there was none. And amid all
there was the danger from enemies, legal or
piratical, for the world was only slowly ridding
itself of the latter; and from the inherent dangers
of the sea itself to the clumsy ships which
slowly worked their way across it. How great
these last were, through the ignorance at that
time of the law of storms, may be known by the
fate of a great fleet which in 1782 left the West
Indies under Admiral Graves, with ten line-of-battle
ships convoying nearly a hundred
merchantmen. Among the former were six of
the prizes taken in Rodney&#8217;s great naval battle
of April 12, 1782. Caught in a fierce gale
southeast of Nova Scotia, five of the battleships
foundered with nearly all on board. One of
those which went down with every soul was the
<i>Ville de Paris</i>, which had been the flagship of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
the unfortunate Count de Grasse. The total
loss of men was estimated at 3,500.</p>

<p>Such was the setting of the period which saw
the birth of the first American navy, which was
to have an existence of but eight short years, to
be succeeded, however, nine years after (1794)
by the modest beginnings which have grown into
the great fleet of to-day, and whose history is
one of uninterrupted success and honor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In September</span>, 1744, there met at Philadelphia,
then our foremost city, representatives of each
of the thirteen colonies, called together on account
of the increasing difficulties which had
arisen with the mother country. These difficulties
arose mainly from the tendency of parliament
to govern the colonies as it would, say,
any county of England. This right the Americans
denied. They were good subjects of the
King, but they objected to parliamentary rule.
The underlying idea which governed the action
of the Americans was thus that of a federalism
which only in these latter days has laid
hold in any considerable degree of the minds of
the English, who now debate the possibility
of England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa becoming
states of a federation somewhat akin to
our own. But at the time of the outbreak of
our Revolution there was no widespread idea of
separation. It was, however, in the air, and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
some openly advocated. Had there been a complete
renouncement of the right of parliament
to make laws governing the colonies there would,
for the time at least, have been a reconciliation.
It was upon this principle we divided. Thus
the war began.</p>

<p>There was at this time on our coast a British
naval force of four ships of from seventy to
fifty guns (these at Boston), and twenty from
twenty to six guns distributed from New
Hampshire to Florida. The whole was a very
moderate force considering the long-standing
discontent and the difficulties of the existing
situation. The British navy, in which, as in
the administration of every other department
of the British public service of the period, inefficiency
and dishonesty reigned to an almost
unbelievable degree, had been allowed to run
down sadly after the Seven Years&#8217; War which
ended in 1763. The total number of ships was
but 270 and the number of seamen but 18,000.
Before the war closed the ships were to number
468, of which 174 were ships-of-the-line (carrying
from sixty to one hundred guns), and the
seamen were to number 110,000.</p>

<p>The situation of the United States was much
akin to that of the Southern Confederacy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Its resources were too meagre to carry on a war
without the importation of much that was necessary
to keep an army in efficiency. Thus the
true plan of England was a strict blockade and
the reduction to inanition of our forces, such as
we ourselves carried on against the South in our
Civil War. This action was advocated strongly
by Viscount Barrington, the Secretary for War,
who urged that the navy only should be employed,
and that the ships should take possession
of all our ports and establish a complete
blockade. Fortunately for the revolutionists,
his advice was not heeded.</p>

<p>On April 19, 1775, at Concord and Lexington,
the long-prepared fagots of revolution were
lighted into flame. Two months later, June
17th, came Bunker Hill and the immediate
assembling near Boston (where lay almost the
whole of the British force in America) of a multitude
of country people ill-provided with everything
that goes to make the efficiency of an army
but high determination and spirit. By a stroke of
prescience which would seem a providence, Washington
was appointed the commander-in-chief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There had been fights afloat between the
Americans and the British some years before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
the actual outbreak of the Revolution. In
1769 the sloop <i>Liberty</i>, employed in revenue
protection, had been seized and burned by the
people of Newport, Rhode Island; in 1772 a
schooner, the <i>Gaspee</i>, used for similar service
in Narragansett Bay and which had grounded
while in chase of a suspected vessel near Providence,
was boarded by a party of men who
burned her, and but a month after the first
fights ashore occurred there were attacks with
some loss of life upon an armed schooner and
barges which attempted the seizure of livestock
on the islands of Boston Bay. The lively fights
at Machias in June, 1775, in which the inhabitants
had captured the sloop <i>Unity</i> and another
which had been sent to Machias for lumber and
which were under the escort of an armed tender,
the <i>Margaretta</i>, were, however, the first of the
actual War of the Revolution. They are proud
recollections of local history and have caused
the name of the town to appear on the navy list
as that of a small cruiser of to-day. On August
9, 1775, the <i>Falcon</i>, sloop-of-war under Captain
Linzee, pursued into Gloucester harbor
two schooners bound from the West Indies;
one he seized, and the other succeeding in getting
into the harbor was attacked by boats from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the <i>Falcon</i>. The militia and inhabitants gathered,
and the action which came on and which
lasted several hours resulted in the capture of
thirty-five of the <i>Falcon&#8217;s</i> men who had come
into the harbor in the captured schooner and in
their own boats, both schooners remaining in
the hands of the Americans.</p>

<p>To Washington himself was due the first
organized force of the Americans in the Revolution
upon the sea. Throughout his career he
recognized the importance of its control, and
immediately on his arrival at Cambridge to take
the command of the American army then collected
before Boston, he began to look into the
question of a naval force, with a view to capturing
the enemy&#8217;s supplies. Such capture
would not only be a deprivation to the British
forces, but a much needed aid to the Americans
who needed everything which goes to support
an army, excepting food, which the surrounding
country supplied for the moment plentifully
enough. But arms, both small and great,
clothing, ammunition, and tentage were imperatively
needed. Such in quantities were on
the ocean on their way to America for the
British army, and the first need was to bring
them into American hands. Washington thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
established a little navy of his own, with a prize
court necessary to pass upon the propriety of the
capture and commissioners to take charge of
captured material. He continued such efforts
even after the transfer of the army to New York,
and did not cease from them until the Continental
Congress took the subject in hand.</p>

<p>The beginning of Washington&#8217;s fleet was the
schooner <i>Hannah</i>, which sailed under Captain
Nicholas Broughton from Beverly, Massachusetts,
on September 5, 1775, and returned two
days later with a prize. Naturally many of
the improvised army assembled at Cambridge,
which was mainly made up of New Englanders,
were men of the sea, and thus soon there
were eight small vessels, officered and manned
from the army in service. The administration
of this improvised navy was not an easy task.
Washington, writing to the President of the
Congress on December 4, 1775, says: &#8220;The
plague, trouble, and vexation I have had with
the crews of all the armed vessels is inexpressible.
I do not believe there is on earth a
more disorderly set.&#8221; Successes came, however,
and with these greater contentment
among the crews. Captain John Manley was
particularly successful, especially in the capture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
of the brigantine <i>Nancy</i>, which carried ordnance
stores of the highest value to our poorly equipped
army. The inventory of her cargo gives, among
other things, 2,000 muskets, thirty-one tons of
musket shot, 3,000 round shot, a considerable
quantity of powder, and a thirteen-inch mortar,
which was promptly mounted in Cambridge
and called the &#8220;Congress.&#8221;</p>

<p>The British evacuated Boston through want
of food, on March 17, 1776, going first to Halifax
and thence to New York. Washington had
already transferred his army thither and continued
his navy, such as it was, until he himself
retreated from New York as the result of the
unfortunate battle of Long Island.</p>

<p>Rhode Island had, however, taken action
toward a sea force several months before Washington
had formed his little fleet. The Rhode
Island Assembly had, on June 15, 1775, two
days before the battle of Bunker Hill, ordered
the chartering of two sloops and had appointed
Abraham Whipple to the chief command.
Whipple was prompt to act, for on the same day
he captured the tender to the frigate <i>Rose</i>, the
first prize of the war. His evident courage and
vigor caused his appointment later as captain
in the regular navy which was soon to come.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Rhode Island has also the honor of being the
first state to take action toward the establishment
of a national navy. Her delegates were
instructed on August 26, 1775, to bring the
question of a fleet before Congress. This was
done on October 3d. The subject received an
almost immediate impetus through the arrival
of information of two brigs which had left
England for Quebec with arms, powder, and
stores. A committee of three was proposed to
prepare a plan to intercept these, but the idea
met with strong opposition as being initiatory
to a Continental navy, as in fact it was. It was
declared by some opposed to be the &#8220;most
wild, visionary, mad project that had ever been
imagined. It was an infant taking a mad bull
by the horns, ... it would ruin the character
and morals of our seamen; it would make
them selfish, piratical, mercenary, bent wholly
upon plunder.&#8221; Much of such criticism of the
project might have been spared. Our seamen
had been living through an age of privateering,
and one in which the latter often recked but too
little of legal capture, and they had too long
been accustomed to the general system of illicit
commerce with the islands of the West Indies
belonging to France and Spain to have their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
morals upset by fighting for their country. The
better sense prevailed and the three men who
had urged most strongly the proposed action
were, on October 5, 1775, appointed a committee
to report a scheme of action. These were
John Adams of Massachusetts, John Langdon
of New Hampshire, and Silas Deane of Connecticut.</p>

<p>The immediate advice of the committee
which was to instruct Washington to procure
two cruisers in Massachusetts, one to carry ten,
and the other fourteen, guns, for the purpose of
intercepting the two brigs mentioned, was soon
changed in a report of October 30, 1775, advising
to add two more vessels, one to mount
not more than twenty, the other not more than
thirty-six, guns, to be employed &#8220;for the protection
and defence of the United Colonies.&#8221;
The question of the capture of special ships had
been dropped; the subject had become national.</p>

<p>On December 14, 1775, the &#8220;Naval Committee&#8221;
was replaced by a committee of thirteen
chosen by ballot. The membership was
remarkably like that of some naval committees
of later times. Scarcely any on it were really
conversant with matters of the sea, but it held
one man, Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
energy, resource, and ability caused Congress
to put in his sole control, before the war ended,
all the affairs of the navy. Agents were employed
to superintend construction, and prize
agents were appointed. On November 6, 1776,
Paul Jones wrote in his usual vigorous way
to Robert Morris, declaring the necessity of a
Board of Admiralty, and on October 28, 1779,
one was established. Two of the members
were to be members of Congress; the other
three, called commissioners, were to be men
possessing knowledge of naval matters. The
Marine Committee then came to an end, but
the navy boards at Philadelphia and Boston,
each of &#8220;three persons well-skilled in maritime
affairs,&#8221; appointed by Congress &#8220;to execute the
business of the navy under the direction of the
Marine Committee,&#8221; in what became known
as the Middle and Eastern districts, and the
navy agents were retained under this reorganization.
The Board of Admiralty, however,
never materialized. On February 7, 1781,
Congress resolved that naval affairs should be
under a single person, to be called the Secretary
of Marine. The office was never filled. Naval
matters had, as just said, gradually drifted into
the efficient hands of the Superintendent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Finance, Robert Morris, and there they remained
until the navy of the Revolution disappeared
in the sale of the last ship, the <i>Alliance</i>,
in August, 1785. The fact is that naval affairs
in the Revolution suffered equally with those
of the army through the ineptitude and inefficiency
of a Congress which was rather a
board of advice than a government, even when
the Articles of Confederation were adopted,
which was not finally done until March 2,
1781.</p>

<p>On November 2, 1775, $100,000 was voted
for ships, and the committee was authorized to
select officers and seamen. On November 10th
were authorized two battalions of marines. The
first intention was to take them from the army,
but Washington objecting to such weakening of
his force, they were to be raised independently
and, with a curious misunderstanding of their
use, it was provided that they should be &#8220;such
as are good seamen.&#8221; Rules for the government
of the navy were passed November 28th,
and the offices of Captain, Lieutenant, Master,
Master&#8217;s Mate, Surgeon, Chaplain, and Warrant
Officer established. The monthly pay of
captain was $32; of able seaman $6.67, later
raised to $8. A prize court was established.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
The rules, naturally, were taken from those of
the British service, and throughout the whole
existence of our navy there has run a strong
similarity, until of late years when there have
been many changes in the nomenclature of the
ratings of the enlisted men. Both services had
the &#8220;Banyan day,&#8221; when no meat was served,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
though in the American navy this soon ceased
to be an actuality. Such phrases as &#8220;Chips&#8221;
(the carpenter) and &#8220;Jimmy Legs&#8221; (the
master-at-arms) were among the many common
to both services; but one, &#8220;Jack-of-the-Dust&#8221;
(an adjunct of the paymaster&#8217;s department),
which is to-day a rating in the American navy,
is no longer a part of British ratings.</p>

<p>On December 13, 1775, Congress authorized
the building of thirteen frigates, and next day,
December 14th, a committee of thirteen was
chosen by ballot to superintend their construction
and equipment; five of these were to be of
32 guns; five of 28; and three of 24. The
<i>Raleigh</i>, of 32 guns, was built at Portsmouth,
New Hampshire; the <i>Hancock</i>, 32, and <i>Boston</i>,
24, at Salisbury and Newburyport, Massachusetts;
the <i>Warren</i>, 32, and <i>Providence</i>, 28, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Providence, Rhode Island; the <i>Trumbull</i>, 28,
at Chatham, on the Connecticut River; the
<i>Montgomery</i>, 24, and <i>Congress</i>, 28, at Poughkeepsie,
New York; the <i>Randolph</i>, 32, <i>Washington</i>,
32, <i>Effingham</i>, 28, and <i>Delaware</i>, 24, at
Philadelphia; the <i>Virginia</i>, 28, at Baltimore.
Six of these&mdash;the <i>Montgomery</i>, <i>Congress</i>, <i>Washington</i>,
<i>Effingham</i>, <i>Delaware</i>, and <i>Virginia</i>&mdash;never
got to sea, all being destroyed to prevent
capture except the <i>Virginia</i> which, having
grounded and lost her rudder in the Chesapeake,
was taken by a British force in the bay.</p>

<p>These ships were to cost on the average but
$66,666, and the whole were expected to be
ready by March, 1776. They varied from 121
to 132 feet in length on the gun deck, with a
breadth of from 32.6 to 34.5&frac12;. Their armament
was that of the frigates of the day: 12-pounders
on the main deck and 6-pounders on
the quarter deck and forecastle. All should have
been ready by the time named, for the <i>Raleigh</i>
was launched at Portsmouth but two months
after her keel was laid. But ill-luck pursued
them throughout, and particularly in that the
free life and greater gains of the privateersman
made it almost impossible to get crews.</p>

<p>Thus the four ships the purchase of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
was authorized on October 30, 1775, were the
first of our navy. These were the <i>Alfred</i>, of
24 guns; <i>Columbus</i>, 20; <i>Andrew Doria</i>, 14, and
the <i>Cabot</i>, 16.</p>

<p>Such was the beginning of the Continental
navy which was to have a life of but ten years.
A few words will complete our story of naval
construction. On November 20, 1776, Congress
resolved to build &#8220;immediately&#8221; a 74 in
New Hampshire; a 74 and a 36 in Massachusetts;
a 74, a brig, 18, and a packet boat in
Pennsylvania; two frigates, 36 each, in Virginia;
and two frigates, 36 each, in Maryland.
But in July, 1777, on account of the high cost
of wages and material, Congress authorized
stopping work on such as the committee might
judge proper, and the final result was the completion
and getting to sea of but three: the
<i>Alliance</i>, 36, the <i>General Gates</i>, 18, both built
in Massachusetts, and the <i>Saratoga</i>, 16, in
Pennsylvania. Only one 74 was built. This
was the <i>America</i>, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
and she was not launched until the war
had practically ended.</p>

<p>During the early part of 1776 there were built
on Lake Champlain, under the direction of
Benedict Arnold, two schooners with eight 6<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
and 4 pounders; a sloop with ten guns of like
calibre; a cutter with one 12, one 9, and two 6;
one galley with two 18-pounders and eight 12,
and two others of nearly equal armament;
eight gondolas with three 8 and 9 pounders, and
two other small craft. These, as will be seen
later, were to fight a memorable action.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ships put afloat by Congress and which may
be taken as the regular navy of the Revolution
were, however, strongly supplemented by the
navies of the states (except New Jersey and Delaware),
and by the multitude of privateers
which cruised under both state and Continental
commissions. Massachusetts led in the number
of state ships; but South Carolina in size
and importance. Massachusetts had sixteen
vessels, the only one of any size being the <i>Protector</i>,
a ship carrying 26 light guns. All the
others carried but from ten to twenty. This
&#8220;navy&#8221; made about seventy captures during
the war. But the state made one most unfortunate
venture, the Penobscot Expedition, to
be mentioned later. New Hampshire had one
small ship, the <i>Hampden</i>, of 22 guns; Georgia,
four galleys (vessels propelled by both sails and
oars). Connecticut had a navy of ten vessels,
the largest of which were the <i>Oliver Cromwell</i>, of
18 guns, and the <i>Defence</i>, of 14. All had disappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
by loss or capture by July, 1779, after
having made some thirty captures. There
was, however, throughout the war great activity
in Long Island Sound where there was a
warfare of boats against the illicit traffic carried
on to supply the British at New York. As always,
greed frequently overcame patriotism,
and smuggling in both directions was rife
throughout the war.</p>

<p>The situation of New York, with its one port
in possession of the enemy, precluded anything
of a patriot naval force except a few galleys on
the Hudson. Pennsylvania, however, had in
1777 a total of fifty-one vessels on the Delaware,
the only important one in size being the
small purchased ship <i>Montgomery</i>; all the
others were but armed boats of the type known
as galleys. In 1777 there were in the state
naval service (which was administered by a
board of six, later of ten) a total of about 700
officers and men. The activities of this force
were confined to the Delaware River and Bay,
and when the British army was transferred to
Philadelphia in 1777 these activities were very
active indeed, including the burning of a British
line-of-battle ship, the <i>Augusta</i>, 64, and the
sloop-of-war <i>Merlin</i>, 18, which had grounded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
All these vessels were finally driven up the Delaware
by an overpowering force, except the
<i>Montgomery</i> and several smaller craft, which had
to be burned to escape capture. What remained
after the British evacuation of Philadelphia
in 1778, when the French fleet had
appeared on our coast under the alliance just
made with France, were sold in December of
that year. This remainder consisted of ten
galleys, nine armed boats, the brig <i>Convention</i>,
the sloops <i>Speedwell</i>, <i>Sally</i>, <i>Industry</i>, and <i>Black
Duck</i>, and the schooner <i>Lydia</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Maryland in 1776 invested in a ship called the
<i>Defence</i> carrying twenty-two 6-pounders, the
largest vessel of her coming small navy; two
schooners and seven row galleys formed the remainder.
All except two galleys and a schooner
were sold in 1779, but British success in the
South renewed depredations in the Chesapeake,
and four large barges to carry twenty-five men
each and 9 and 18 pounders and a schooner to
carry ten 4-pounders were ordered. In 1782,
depredations continuing, a ship and four additional
barges were ordered, and in November
of that year such vessels fought a severe and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
most gallant action with an overpowering
British force of the same character, the <i>Protector</i>,
which bore the brunt of the action on the
American side, losing fifty-four killed and
wounded out of her crew of sixty-five. &#8220;Except
when used for commercial purposes, Maryland&#8217;s
vessels rarely passed outside the capes
at the mouth of the Chesapeake.&#8221; Virginia
entered upon the question of a navy with enthusiasm
and a number of vessels were authorized;
the two frigates voted were, however,
never built. Actual construction was confined
to galleys and schooners; the number first and
last, though very considerable, is indefinite.
The state established a navy yard on the Chickahominy,
operated a ropewalk, and established
naval magazines. The whole force practically
disappeared during the raid by Phillips and
Arnold when on April 27, 1780, a few miles below
Richmond, six ships, eight brigs, five sloops,
two schooners, and several smaller vessels and
the ropewalk at Warwick were destroyed;
twelve were captured which had escaped destruction,
and but one vessel remained in the
Virginia navy, the armed boat <i>Liberty</i>. A
small force later, in 1782, was gathered which
operated in the Chesapeake (within which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Virginia force remained almost entirely during
the war) until peace in 1783.</p>

<p>Almost foremost in naval activity and expenditure
was South Carolina. The state
owned in all some fifteen vessels, of which the
most important was the <i>Bricole</i>, purchased in
France, and mounting forty-four 24&#8217;s and 18&#8217;s,
though pierced for sixty. She, with nearly all
the other ships of the state, was sunk as an obstacle
to the British in the siege ending in the
surrender of May 11, 1780. She was the largest
American ship of the Revolution in actual service.
There survived the <i>Indian</i>, &#8220;rented&#8221; by
Alexander Gillon, who had been commissioned
as commodore and sent abroad to raise some
&pound;71,000 with which to build three frigates.
The only result was the renting of the <i>Indian</i>,
which had been built by Congress in Holland,
but which, to prevent international complications,
had been sold to the King of France and
by him given to the Chevalier Luxembourg.
The <i>Indian</i> was renamed the <i>South Carolina</i>
and given an armament of twenty-eight 32&#8217;s
and twelve 12&#8217;s, an unusually heavy battery.
It was not until August, 1781, that she got to
sea, cruised for a time in the North Sea, but
arrived at Havana on January 12, 1782, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
five valuable prizes. She formed one of a combined
American and Spanish expedition in May
to the Bahamas, which was successful. On
May 28th she arrived at Philadelphia, where an
agent of Luxembourg caused the removal of
Gillon and the appointment of a Captain Joyner;
she refitted and left for sea in December.
Scarcely outside the Capes of the Delaware, she
was chased by a British squadron and taken
after a two hours&#8217; fight. Luxembourg demanded
under the contract an indemnity of
300,000 livres (francs). This Gillon denied,
claiming his removal to be a breach of contract.
The claims were unsettled until December,
1874, when the state of South Carolina paid
$28,894 to the heirs of Luxembourg as a final
settlement. South Carolina is still prosecuting
her claims against the United States for a
reimbursement of her expenditures for this
ship.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The efforts at a state navy of North Carolina,
Georgia, and Rhode Island were of too moderate
a character to need much comment. That
of the first consisted of three brigantines in
1778 and the addition of a small ship, the <i>Caswell</i>,
in 1778. By June, 1779, all had disappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
by sale or (in the case of the <i>Caswell</i>) by
sinking at Ocracoke. Georgia had but four
galleys. But two sloops and two galleys were
the extent of Rhode Island&#8217;s navy, though it was
this state, as mentioned, which took the first
steps toward naval defence.</p>

<p>Of vastly greater importance than the state
navies were the privateers, a service congenial
to the New England seamen from every point
of view. There was &#8220;more money in it&#8221;; there
was the absence of a strict and irksome discipline,
and the cruises were short. The great
number of privateers fitting out made it a matter
of extreme difficulty to find men for the
ships of the regular service, which thus not infrequently
had to lie idle and unemployed.
Had a tithe of the effort expended upon privateers
been expended upon the building and
equipment of a navy, it is not unfair to say that
the general results would probably have been
much better. But privateering had already
been a much-indulged-in occupation. The
Seven Years&#8217; War had ended only in 1763, and
during this period many American privateers
were afloat. The slave trade also was a favorite
New England occupation, and piracy itself at
the period was not altogether disreputable if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
applied only to those &#8220;natural enemies,&#8221; the
French and Spanish. Nearly all the officers of
the new Continental navy had their first war
training in privateers, and very frequently
during the Revolution officers took a hand at
privateering in the moments of enforced leisure
when there was no naval ship to which they
could be assigned.</p>

<p>Congress authorized privateering on March
23, 1776, and a list printed by the Library of
Congress shows the number and kind of vessels
furnished with letters of marque by the Continental
Congress. This gives a total of such
of 1,697. Of these there were ships 301; brigs
and brigantines, 541; schooners and sloops, 751;
boats and galleys, 104. These are accredited to
the several states as follows: New Hampshire,
43; Massachusetts, 626; Rhode Island, 15;
Connecticut, 218; New York, 1; New Jersey, 4;
Pennsylvania, 500; Maryland, 225; Virginia,
64; South Carolina, 1. Distributed by years
there were afloat in 1776, 34; 1777, 69; 1778,
129; 1779, 209; 1780, 301; 1781, 550; 1783,
22. These altogether carried 14,872 guns and
58,400 men. It is, of course, almost a certainty
that many of these vessels were duplicated
in this list, but such duplication is more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
than offset by the issuance of letters of marque
by the several states and in France and the
West Indies which, according to an excellent
authority, would carry the number to over
2,000, with 18,000 guns and 70,000 men.
&#8220;Judging from the scanty information at hand
concerning British privateering, it is probable
that their vessels engaged in this form of warfare
were considerably less numerous but decidedly
superior in force to the Americans; the
latter seem to have carried on an average between
eight and nine guns and less than thirty-five
men; the British about seventeen guns and
seventy-five or more men.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The value of the captures of the privateers
was about $18,000,000; that of the captures of
the navy, which had thirty-one ships afloat in
1776, thirty-four in 1777, and but seven in
1782, was, proportioned to the number of ships
employed, much greater, being some $6,000,000.
Altogether (i. e., by both services) some 800 vessels
were captured. Our own losses were also very
great, but not nearly so great as those of Britain.
About 16,000 prisoners were taken afloat, only
6,000 less than those taken by the army.</p>

<p>By July, 1776, the British fleet in the vicinity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
of New York, where the attack was about to
take place on the American army assembled on
Long Island near Brooklyn, which resulted in
our defeat and the occupancy of New York for
the remainder of the war, consisted of nine ships
of from 50 to 64 guns; three of 44; twenty-seven
of from 28 to 32; fourteen of 20; eleven of 14 to
18; sixteen of from 8 to 10&mdash;a total of eighty
ships of war. This fleet was under the command
of Richard Viscount Howe, whose brother,
General Howe, was commander-in-chief of the
army of 34,614 men, of whom 13,167 were of
the 29,867 Hessians hired for the war by Great
Britain. These two brothers were for some two
years to conduct the British main operations in
America. One, the admiral, was an officer of
great ability and rose to high distinction; the
General was handicapped by a slothful and unenterprising
disposition with a character marred
by an extreme looseness in moral conduct. His
want of enterprise may have been due in part
to the attitude of the Whig party in England,
to which he was attached, and which was opposed
in general to the use of force against
America. In any case, his qualities were such
that they went a long way toward the establishment
of American independence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>In addition to Howe&#8217;s fleet there were, under
Commodore Sir Peter Parker, two 50-gun ships,
four of 28, two of 20, and three of 8 guns. These
were to be employed against Charleston, South
Carolina.</p>

<p>On Lake Champlain the British were to have
during 1776 a ship of eighteen 12-pounders, a
schooner of fourteen 6-pounders; another of 12;
three &#8220;Radeaux&#8221; (flat-bottomed craft), one
carrying six 24-pounders, one six 12-pounders,
and one two howitzers. There were also a
gondola (with oars) carrying seven 9-pounders,
and twenty gunboats, each with a brass field
piece of from 24 to 9 pounds.</p>

<p>The naval force here mentioned was at times
reinforced by accessions of line-of-battle ships,
as many as twenty-one being at times available.
The British, however, with an unwise conception
of the true strategy of the situation, were
constantly diverting these to the West Indies,
which, during our Revolution, after war was
declared by France and Spain, was the great
field of naval action. It is within bounds to
say that they lost the United States for the sake
of the West India Islands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It was</span> not until February, 1776, that what may
be termed a strictly naval event took form in
the sailing of the little fleet in command of
Commodore Esek Hopkins, under orders which
were sufficiently explicit in primary meaning,
viz.: to proceed to Chesapeake Bay and destroy
the powerful flotilla which the royal governor
of Virginia had gathered together and with
which he was harassing the Chesapeake shores.
Hopkins was then to proceed to the Carolinas
and act in like manner against the enemy&#8217;s
forces, after which he was to go to Rhode Island.
A final phrase, however, left a loophole for
other action: &#8220;if bad winds or stormy weather&#8221;
or any other accident should prevent, he was to
use his own judgment.</p>

<p>Hopkins flew his broad-pennant in the <i>Alfred</i>,
in which also was then hoisted by the hands of
Lieutenant John Paul Jones a Continental flag
which bore a rattlesnake and a motto, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
tread on me,&#8221; on a yellow ground. The exact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
date of this incident is unknown. The other
vessels of the squadron were the ship <i>Columbus</i>,
20; the brig <i>Andrew Doria</i>, 14; brig <i>Cabot</i>, 14;
brig <i>Providence</i>, 12; sloop <i>Hornet</i>, 10; schooner
<i>Wasp</i>, 8; schooner <i>Fly</i>, 8. The number of
men was about 880.</p>

<p>Hopkins, instead of going to the Chesapeake,
directed his course, on the plea of bad weather,
to New Providence in the Bahamas, where
there were considerable stores of powder and
cannon of which the newly formed Continental
army was in utmost need. Though blamed
later by enemies, Hopkins took the wiser course.
His advent there on March 3d was a complete
surprise: 250 men were landed and possession
taken of the little town and forts without resistance.
Two weeks was spent in getting
aboard the guns, of which there were seventy-one,
from 9 to 32 pounders. There were also
fifteen brass mortars and twenty-four barrels of
powder. The governor, unfortunately, had
succeeded in sending away 150 of the latter.
The guns, however, were an extremely important
prize, and to carry these and other public
property seized, a sloop was impressed. Hopkins
sailed north on March 17th, carrying the
governor, lieutenant-governor, and another official.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
By this time Newport, Rhode Island,
was occupied by a British force, and New London
was selected instead as a port of return.
When off Block Island the British man-of-war
<i>Glasgow</i>, of 20 guns and 150 men, was sighted,
and a running action took place, in which the
<i>Glasgow</i>, though much injured, escaped into
Newport. The explanation of the American
commander was that the firing must bring aid
from Newport to the <i>Glasgow&#8217;s</i> rescue, and in
fact two vessels in the harbor did get under way
to go out. The force in Newport, however,
which was only the small frigate <i>Rose</i>, of 20
guns, the <i>Nautilus</i> and <i>Swan</i>, of 16 each, and
several tenders, was no more than an equal
match for our own. As far as one can read into
this event, there was not the energy shown by
our people which should have been. Giving
up the action, the American squadron reached
New London with all its prize intact. The
Commodore&#8217;s practical disobedience of orders
was fully condoned by Congress, and he received
a letter of congratulation from President
John Hancock.</p>

<p>The British squadron, suffering a good deal
from fire from batteries on shore, had left Newport
on April 5th, and Hopkins entered Narragansett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Bay, going to Providence on April
25th. So many of his men had sickened on the
cruise from the poor food, bad water, and want
of general hygiene aboard ship at that period,
that he had landed 200 at New London. He
now found it impossible to get men. Some soldiers
who had been temporarily lent from the
army were demanded back by Washington,
and there ensued a painful period for the unhappy
Commodore. Great complaints of ill-treatment
went to Congress. Hopkins&#8217; manners
to his officers were severely criticised, and
the whole ended in an official inquiry which included
his disobedience of orders, his allowing
the <i>Glasgow</i> to escape, and his inactivity since
his return. He was not entirely cleared on the
first two charges, but the prevalent sickness
among his men and the impossibility of getting
new crews on account of the active fitting out
of privateers were certainly sufficient to exonerate
him from the third. Notwithstanding,
and although he was energetically defended
by John Adams, he received a formal censure
from Congress, but was allowed for the moment
to retain his command. In regard to the question
of roughness toward his subordinates which
was involved in the charges, it must be considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
that all officers of the period had entered
the Continental service from the rough life of
the merchantman of the time; many had
served in privateers; the officers of the British
navy itself were themselves not altogether
lamblike, if we are to believe Smollet, who had
personal experience as a surgeon&#8217;s mate. It
was in many ways a rough age afloat and ashore
and in every society, and such charges as were
brought against Hopkins cannot justly be
judged from our present standpoint. Certainly
John Paul Jones, his first lieutenant, wrote
him at this time a kindly and sympathetic
letter regarding this trial. Though Hopkins
remained yet some time in the service, it was
not for long. His enemies, and apparently they
were not few, again brought charges against
him. As a result, Congress on March 26, 1777,
resolved that he be suspended from his command,
and on January 2, 1778, he was dismissed
from the service. That the service suffered
thereby can hardly be said, as he was now sixty
years old, an old age for that period, and was
scarcely equal to the exercise of vigorous command,
but the fact remains that he met unduly
harsh treatment.</p>

<p>Hopkins&#8217;s squadron was now broken up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
though the several ships had remained under
his general orders until his dismissal. They
cruised chiefly &#8220;down East&#8221; off New England
and Nova Scotia, making a number of prizes,
one of which, the <i>Mellish</i>, taken by the <i>Alfred</i>,
now commanded by Jones, carried a cargo of
soldiers&#8217; clothing for Burgoyne&#8217;s army of 13,000
men now in Canada, intended to proceed by
Lake Champlain to New York and thus occupy
a line which would separate New England entirely
from the rest of the country.</p>

<p>A considerable fleet chiefly of gunboats had,
as mentioned, been built by the British for
service on Lake Champlain. The offset to this,
by the building of a flotilla under Arnold, has
also already been noted. The building of this
little fleet was to change history.</p>

<p>The British naval preparations were so delayed
that it was not until October, 1776 (on
the 11th and 13th), that the two forces came together,
with the result, after a most gallant
contest, of a defeat to the Americans, who retreated
up the lake, destroying all their vessels
but one galley, a sloop, and two small schooners,
and the galley <i>Washington</i>, which last was captured.
The gallantry of the American force
is all the more to be commended as it was one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
gathered from raw material, most of which was
unaccustomed to work of the kind it was called
upon to do; the British, on the other hand, were
all men-of-war&#8217;s men &#8220;detached from his Majesty&#8217;s
ships and vessels in the river St. Lawrence
to serve on Lake Champlain,&#8221; to the number of
670.</p>

<p>As the Americans were about 700, the forces
were almost equal in numbers. It was far
otherwise in strength, the British in numbers of
vessels, in size, and in armament far outclassing
the Americans. They were in numbers 29 to
15, and the ship <i>Inflexible</i> alone, which carried
eighteen 12-pounders, was able to look after
a large proportion of the American squadron.
The American loss was over eighty; that of the
British did not exceed forty. The former had
lost all, but to good purpose, for this little fleet
had delayed the advance southward of Burgoyne&#8217;s
army another year, thus giving time
to prepare resistance, and what perhaps was
equally to the purpose, so far as the fortunes of
America were concerned, affording time to
General Howe to carry out, in July, 1777, his
views as to the necessity of occupying Philadelphia;
for had Burgoyne, as proposed, started
from Canada in the summer of 1776, Howe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
with his whole large army would have been at
New York within easy support of this movement
of so vital moment to the British. As it was,
in 1777, the forces were widely separated, and
Burgoyne, instead of being aided as he had expected,
went to his destruction. Thus &#8220;Never,&#8221;
says Clowes in the great history of &#8220;The Royal
Navy,&#8221; speaking of this action, &#8220;had any force,
big or small, lived to better purpose or died more
gloriously.&#8221; &#8220;That the war spread from America
to Europe, from the English Channel to
the Baltic, from the Bay of Biscay to the Mediterranean,
from the West Indies to the Mississippi,
and ultimately involved the remote
waters of Hindostan, is traceable, through Saratoga,
to the rude flotilla which in 1776 anticipated
its enemy in the possession of Lake
Champlain.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was as just mentioned when Burgoyne
most needed support in his advance south the
next year (1777) that, Sir William Howe (the
British commander-in-chief in America) embarked
14,000 men, and escorted by the fleet
under command of his brother, Lord Howe,
sailed from Sandy Hook, the expedition numbering
280 ships, including the transports and
men-of-war. Eight thousand men were left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
at New York under Sir Henry Clinton. Howe&#8217;s
objective was Philadelphia. His first intention
was to go up the Delaware, but obstructions
in the river being reported by one of the naval
captains, he changed to the very roundabout
way of the Chesapeake Bay. He was not able
to land his troops at the head of the bay until
August 25th. He defeated Washington at the
battle of the Brandywine on September 11th, and
on the 26th occupied Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The General&#8217;s brother, Lord Howe, in command
of the fleet, was a good month returning
from the head of the Chesapeake round to and
up the Delaware as far as Chester, where he
arrived on October 6th, so slow and uncertain
were the movements of sailing ships in those
days. A small squadron had been sent in
advance to clear the channel. This move on
the part of the British to occupy the river was
necessary to keep up the supplies of their army.
In this fleet there were eleven vessels, two of
which were 64&#8217;s, one 50, and three frigates of
28 to 44 guns. The total of their armament was
364 guns, 74 of which were 24-pounders, with
somewhat over 2,000 men. To resist this
powerful force there were in the river the new
Continental frigate <i>Delaware</i>, of twenty-four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
12-pounders; the brig <i>Andrew Doria</i>, of fourteen
6-pounders; and the sloop <i>Hornet</i>, with twelve
9-pounders; besides six smaller vessels carrying
from four to ten 9-pounders, and twelve galleys
with one gun each, of 18, 24, or 32 pounds.
These were assisted by the whole of the Pennsylvania
navy, which consisted of the ship <i>Montgomery</i>,
of fourteen 14-pounders, and thirty-eight
small craft carrying fifty-one guns varying
from 4 to 18 pounders. The total armament
was 175 guns. The combined Continental and
state fleets were under the command of Commodore
John Hazelwood of the latter. To
support these there were Fort Mifflin on an
island, with also two small batteries on the mainland,
just below the mouth of the Schuylkill
and two miles from League Island on the Pennsylvania
side, and opposite, on the New Jersey
shore, at Red Bank, Fort Mercer; a battery opposite
Hog Island, and three and a half miles
below this, another. Obstructions of heavy
timbers, shod at their points with iron, were
placed opposite this last battery and in the
channel near Fort Mifflin.</p>

<p>The Delaware River has a somewhat tortuous,
and in places a narrow, channel. Its defensive
advantages are thus very strong, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the Americans had a fair chance of success.
The most powerful of the naval defence was
lost in the beginning by the grounding of the
<i>Delaware</i> near a British battery on the city
front.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, the Americans made a fine
defence of more than six weeks. It was not
until November 10th that the British succeeded
in clearing the river to Philadelphia and then
with heavy loss in men and in ships, two of
which, a ship-of-the-line and a sloop-of-war,
were burned. Later, in May, 1778, they invaded
the river above Philadelphia. The frigates
<i>Washington</i> and <i>Effingham</i>, nearly ready
for sea, had to be burned, and besides these a
ship of 18 guns, and brigs, schooners, and small
craft, some fifty-four in all, destroyed; a sad
ending to a long and gallant struggle.</p>

<p>It was in the Delaware that in December,
1777, David Bushnell made a second trial of his
torpedoes (the first having been in the Hudson).
He used kegs of powder fitted with a
detonating fuse, which should have succeeded.
No damage was done through, as Bushnell
claims, bad management. The British fleet
was alarmed enough, however, to justify Francis
Hopkinson, one of the signers of American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Independence, in producing the well-known
poem of the &#8220;Battle of the Kegs,&#8221; once a
favorite with our fathers.</p>

<p>The <i>Randolph</i>, <i>Hancock</i>, <i>Raleigh</i>, and <i>Boston</i>
were the only frigates at sea in this year. The
<i>Hancock</i>, Captain Manley, was captured July
7th, on this her first cruise, by a British forty-four;
the <i>Raleigh</i>, under Captain John Barry,
during an action with two British ships, one of
which was of 50 guns, ran on a rocky islet near
Penobscot Bay, September 27, 1778. Her crew
escaped ashore, but the ship, though an effort
had been made to burn her, was hauled off by
the British. Both the captured ships were
taken into the British service. The <i>Randolph</i>,
which had been one of the earliest of the new
frigates to get to sea, had, in the period of her
sea service, been actively cruising in our southern
waters under the command of Captain
Biddle, and was ordered to France in October,
1777. She remained there but a short time
owing to the protests of the British ambassador
against our ships remaining in French ports, and
returned to Charleston, whence she had sailed.
Here a squadron was organized with four other
small vessels of the South Carolina navy, which
went to sea February 12, 1778, and cruised in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the vicinity of the Windward Islands. On
March 7th was met the <i>Yarmouth</i>, 64. Biddle
gallantly engaged the ship twice his force, but
the <i>Randolph</i> after an action of about fifteen
minutes blew up. Only four men were saved,
and these were picked up five days after the explosion,
on a piece of wreckage, by the <i>Yarmouth</i>,
which meanwhile had been actively
cruising. The incident is certainly among the
most extraordinary of happenings even on the
sea, so prolific in adventures. Three hundred
and eleven men were lost besides officers. The
loss of Captain Biddle, one of the most promising
of our sea officers, was specially deplored.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Silas Deane</span> had been the first American agent
abroad, reaching Europe in July, 1776. Franklin
and Arthur Lee arrived in France in December
of that year, the former in the brig <i>Reprisal</i>,
which was the first American man-of-war to
visit the eastern hemisphere. Seldom has there
been a ship whose safety meant so much; for
upon Franklin&#8217;s great social and political influence
was to depend the aid of France, and
upon this aid, American independence. The
<i>Reprisal</i> had taken several prizes which she had
carried into Nantes, and the reception of these
and the many to come later into French and
Spanish ports caused strong protests from England
to which these governments had to give
heed. The commissioners were to purchase or
hire eight line-of-battle ships as well as a frigate
and two cutters, but their endeavors fell far
short of such a program. Nevertheless, all
things considered, aid in money, and particularly
in much needed army stores, was forthcoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
to a surprising degree, and the name of
Beaumarchais in France and that of Gardoqui
in Spain, who acted at Bilbao as Beaumarchais&#8217;s
agent, deserve lasting remembrance by Americans.
In 1778 Deane was replaced by John
Adams, who, accompanied by his son, John
Quincy, then eleven years old, sailed from Boston
on February 15th in the frigate <i>Boston</i>, and
reached Bordeaux on April 1st. Naval interests,
after Deane&#8217;s recall, were taken over
chiefly by Franklin.</p>

<p>The war had lasted three years, but now in
this year of 1778 it was to take a new development.
The immediate cause was the surrender
of Burgoyne at Saratoga on October 17, 1777.
The chain of causes was, as already mentioned,
the resistance offered on Lake Champlain the
previous year (1776) by the flotilla under Arnold,
the transfer of the main part of the British
force from New York to Philadelphia when it
should have been employed to support Burgoyne,
and the too leisurely movement of Clinton
up the Hudson with a large portion of the
8,000 men left at New York. Clinton captured
the forts at the Highlands, but he was too
late to save Burgoyne, who surrendered the day
after the British army burned Kingston. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
surrender was a fitting nemesis for such an act.
A greater strategic failure than was this campaign
on the part of the British is not recorded
in history, nor has there ever been one with
more momentous consequences. It convinced
the French Government, smarting under its
loss of Canada in the treaty of 1763, that there
was now a fair chance of American success, and
on February 6, 1778, was signed the treaty of
alliance which brought the ships the aid of
which was so vital to our success. Two months
later, April 13, 1778, Vice-Admiral Charles
Henri Theodat d&#8217;Estaing du Saillans, generally
known to us as the Count d&#8217;Estaing, sailed
from Toulon with twelve battleships and five
frigates. Two of these ships were of 80 guns,
six of 74, three of 64, and one of 50. The naval
story of our Revolution, though its greatest
exploits in the cruise of Paul Jones and the capture
of the <i>Serapis</i> were yet to come, must,
henceforward, be largely of French ships.</p>

<p>The French commander had one of the greatest
chances in history. The British fleet was
in the Delaware awaiting the preparation of the
British army to return to New York from Philadelphia.
Howe had but six 64&#8217;s, three 50&#8217;s,
and six frigates. They had been a sure prey to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the French had there been in command a man
of greater energy. But d&#8217;Estaing had been
transferred at the mature age of thirty-five
from the army to the navy, the profession of all
others which requires a life-long familiarity,
and where the rigidity and formality of the
army school of the period were wholly out of
place. There have been rare exceptions to the
general rule, Blake being a notable example, but
d&#8217;Estaing was not one of these. He was, says a
French writer, &#8220;detested from the first&mdash;the
word is not too strong&mdash;by most of his officers.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Whether through bad luck or want of energy,
he was more than a month (thirty-three days)
in even reaching the Straits of Gibraltar, 700
miles from Toulon, thus making an average of
but twenty-one miles a day.</p>

<p>A British frigate was noted by the French in
passing Gibraltar, which &#8220;tranquilly and comfortably
watched the French fleet defile by in
three columns.&#8221; But this same ship followed
for ninety leagues into the Atlantic, to make
sure of the French course, and then hastened to
England. It arrived there on June 5th, fifty-three
days after d&#8217;Estaing had left Toulon and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
twenty after he had passed the Straits. This
knowledge, however, was not necessary to
British action. A force equal to d&#8217;Estaing&#8217;s
and to be commanded by Vice-Admiral Byron
had already been in preparation, though it had
been hampered as much by poor dockyard administration
and want of men as was d&#8217;Estaing
by his own want of push.</p>

<p>It was not until July 7, 1778, that the French
fleet anchored at the Capes of the Delaware.
But the quarry had gotten away. The British
army had left Philadelphia on June 18th on its
march to Sandy Hook. The scores of transports
carrying the army baggage and stores had
started down the Delaware next day. They did
not get clear of the Capes until June 28th, and,
convoyed by the men-of-war, reached inside of
Sandy Hook on June 30th. Never was greater
opportunity lost. A little earlier and with
Howe&#8217;s fleet captured, the fall of New York,
practically undefended, was a certainty. But
for d&#8217;Estaing&#8217;s want of push the war would
have ended in 1778 instead of five years later.</p>

<p>Howe had heard of d&#8217;Estaing&#8217;s approach.
He made admirable preparations to resist the
entry of New York Bay. D&#8217;Estaing arrived
off Sandy Hook, but though offering the large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
sum of 150,000 francs, pilots were unobtainable,
probably by reason of fearing the vengeance of
the British if they should be taken. On July
22d there was a fresh northeast wind and a
spring (a highest) tide. There was ample
water for any ship of his fleet, but d&#8217;Estaing
and his officers were unacquainted with the
region and did not dare to venture. &#8220;At eight
o&#8217;clock,&#8221; wrote an eyewitness in the British fleet,
&#8220;d&#8217;Estaing, with all his squadron, appeared
under way. He kept working to windward as
if to gain a proper position for crossing the bar
by the time the tide should serve. The wind
... blew from the exact point from which
he could attack us to the greatest advantage.
The spring tides were at the highest.... We
consequently expected the hottest fray that
had been fought between the two nations. On
our side all was at stake. Had the men-of-war
been defeated, the fleet of transports and victualers
must have been destroyed, and the
army of course fallen with us. D&#8217;Estaing,
however, had not spirit equal to the risk; at
three o&#8217;clock we saw him bear off to the southward,
and in a few hours he was out of sight.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Naturally Washington&#8217;s disappointment over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
d&#8217;Estaing&#8217;s failure was great. The great prize
had been lost. He had, however, arranged with
d&#8217;Estaing that should the latter not attack
New York, he would go to Newport, Rhode Island,
and assist General John Sullivan in attacking
the British force of some 6,000, which,
supported by six ships-of-war, held Newport.</p>

<p>D&#8217;Estaing anchored off Newport (outside the
bay) on July 29, 1778. The next day Suffren,
with two ships-of-the-line, went into the channel
west of Conanicut Island, and two frigates and
a sloop-of-war entered Sakonnet; whereupon
the British burned the <i>Kingfisher</i>, of 16 guns,
and some galleys stationed there. The British
general, Sir Robert Pigot, withdrew 1,500 Hessians
from Conanicut and concentrated his
forces about the town. Goat Island, where is
now the United States Torpedo Station and
where for many years was a fort, was also occupied,
as this commanded the main channel and
the entrances to the inner harbor. On August
5th Suffren with his two ships went into the
main channel near the north end of Conanicut,
two others taking his former place. Captain
John Brisbane, the senior British naval officer,
now destroyed four frigates, the <i>Flora</i>, <i>Juno</i>,
<i>Lark</i>, and <i>Orpheus</i>, of 32 guns each, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
corvette <i>Falcon</i>, of 16 guns, two being sunk at
the south end of Goat Island. Five transports
were sunk between Goat and Coasters&#8217; Harbor
Island, thus closing both entrances to the inner
harbor. The guns, ammunition, and the thousand
or so men of their crews went to strengthen
the forces of the batteries.</p>

<p>It was not until August 8th that d&#8217;Estaing
with the eight remaining ships-of-the-line ran
the batteries and anchored between Coasters&#8217;
Harbor Island and Conanicut. He was now
joined by the others except one which remained
as a lookout in the West Channel. The long delay
of ten days from the time of arrival had
been at Sullivan&#8217;s request, who was not yet
ready. Two thousand men had been sent by
Washington under Lafayette, but the expected
militia were slow to come in. Things now
looked very black for the British, but the delay
had been fatal.</p>

<p>D&#8217;Estaing on August 9th landed on Conanicut
such of his thousand soldiers in the fleet as
were fit for duty and some two thousand seamen,
in readiness for the morrow&#8217;s attack as
arranged. Scarcely were these landed when
the lifting of the fog revealed the English fleet
at anchor off Point Judith, seven miles southwest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
of Narragansett Bay. Though there were
some thirty ships, there were but one 74, six
64&#8217;s, and five 50&#8217;s, a force wholly inadequate
to meet d&#8217;Estaing&#8217;s. Howe, thus inferior,
could not have ventured into the bay, but his
presence caused d&#8217;Estaing to lose his judgment.
The latter had begun to get his ships into position
for defence, in the prevailing calm, but
next morning when the wind came out from the
northeast, fair for leaving port, but making it
impossible for Howe to come in even had his
force allowed, d&#8217;Estaing in over haste cut his
hemp cables and went to sea. Howe, unable to
meet him, did the same, and now the day and
part of the next were spent in maneuvering for
position in face of a rising storm. The wind
had gradually increased and finally blew with
such force as to make action impossible. Next
day (August 12th) it developed into an &#8220;August
storm,&#8221; a West India hurricane, which had
taken its usual course up our coast, scattering
both fleets and inflicting heavy damage, particularly
upon the French, whose flagship, the
<i>Languedoc</i>, completely dismasted and with
tiller broken, came near being taken on the
13th by a much weaker but wholly manageable
British 50-gun ship, the <i>Renown</i>. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
night saved her. D&#8217;Estaing, with several ships
under jury masts, anchored east of Cape May
and gradually collected his damaged fleet. He
was seen here by Howe, who had now but two
of his ships in company. By August 20th
d&#8217;Estaing was again off Newport, but only to
hold a council of war at which were present
Sullivan and Lafayette. D&#8217;Estaing was willing
to remain two days if the American officers
would guarantee the surrender of Newport in
that time. This they could not do, and the
fleet left for Boston, which was mentioned in the
admiral&#8217;s orders as the place in which he was to
refit in case of need. It is of no use to dwell
upon the bitter feeling aroused among the
Americans, who felt that the British army at
Newport was, with the aid of the fleet, in their
power. In all fairness, however, the failure was
really due to Sullivan&#8217;s own delay, which
changed completely naval conditions. The
siege was raised; the great effort had gone for
nothing but the destruction of a few unimportant
British ships. The British fleet, now heavily
reinforced by the thirteen powerful ships under
Byron which had left England in June, had
command of the sea.</p>

<p>D&#8217;Estaing spent two months refitting at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Boston, and then following the letter of his
orders, left on November 4, 1778, for the West
Indies, where he was much more fortunate, but
where we cannot follow him. His departure left
our coast open to invasion at every point, and
thus Savannah was occupied in December by a
strong British force; it was the beginning of the
Southern invasion which was to cost us dear.</p>

<p>Pressed by our people, d&#8217;Estaing in the
summer of 1779, though he had received orders
to return with his own particular squadron to
France, determined to attempt to dislodge the
British at Savannah. He thus left Santo
Domingo with twenty ships-of-the-line and
seven frigates, and anchored, on August 31,
1779, off Tybee at the mouth of the Savannah
River, on which, eighteen miles from the sea, is
Savannah, then but a small village. Troops
were landed by the French, an attack made, and
an expedition, expected to be completed in
eight days, extended to two months. It ended
in disaster; gale after gale crippled the French
fleet here on an unprotected coast, until on
October 28th it was wholly dispersed. The
flagship was driven to sea with the loss of both
her only remaining anchors, and it was not until
well into December that the main portions came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
together again in the West Indies. D&#8217;Estaing
himself, however, was driven so far to sea that
he determined to return alone to France. This
he did, fortunately meeting the <i>Provence</i> which
gave him an anchor, and reached Brest on
December 7, 1779.</p>

<p>He returned, having accomplished nothing in
aid of the United States itself, however fortunate
in the West Indies. He was severely
judged by naval officers of his service. One,
however, need not go to the extent of Captain
La Clocheterie, whom the Vicomte de Charlus
(who kept a journal when crossing the Atlantic
with Rochambeau&#8217;s expedition next year) reports
as saying: &#8220;He was a coward and a man of
no talent.&#8221; His failure is found rather in the <i>mot</i>
of a really great French sailor, Suffren: &#8220;If he
had only been as much of a seaman as he was
brave&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole conduct of d&#8217;Estaing&#8217;s campaign
illustrates what superior strength at sea might
accomplish but, in this case, did not. If he
had, in going to America, pressed westward,
even to the extent of towing his slow sailers, he
would have made one of the great successes of
history, and have ended the war in America.
Failing this, he could, at once on his arrival,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
have forced the surrender of Newport, upon
which he had but to close his hand and the place,
with its 7,000 soldiers and sailors, and the bay
would have been in possession of the allies. His
fault, militarily considered, was in acceding to
Sullivan&#8217;s request for delay. Reading into the
psychics of the question, this request had its
basis in Sullivan&#8217;s desire to make as good a showing
as possible in the combined operations, and
not from actual necessity, as the powerful
French fleet in itself commanded the situation,
and d&#8217;Estaing&#8217;s compliance came from a natural
desire to meet the wishes of the American
commander. But on neither side was it war.
His leaving the bay at the crisis of events was
an unfortunate want of judgment. His later
action was but part of the ill-judged strategy of
the time which ended in the fall of Charleston and
the British occupancy of the whole South, its
wholesale devastation and well-nigh subjugation.</p>

<p>But neither side, British nor French, could
understand how completely the whole was a
question of naval domination. Washington
saw, but he was powerless to do more than proclaim
again and again the truth, until finally
in 1781 he was listened to, the result of which was
one of the decisive triumphs of all time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> new treaty with France was to bring into
special prominence one of the most remarkable
characters of his time, John Paul Jones. On
October 10, 1776, he had been made the eighteenth
captain on a list of twenty-four then established.
He considered himself ill-treated,
and justly so, as having been first on the list of
lieutenants he should have been placed higher.
His animadversions on the subject, in a letter
to Robert Morris, are worth quoting. It
showed along with some very just criticisms
that he had a high and fitting estimate of his
duties as a sea officer, and of the demands of his
calling. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I cannot but lament that so little delicacy
hath been observed in the appointment and
promotion of officers in the sea service, many of
whom are not only grossly illiterate, but want
even the capacity of commanding merchant vessels.
I was lately on a court-martial where a
captain of marines made his mark and where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
the president could not read the oath which he
attempted to administer without spelling and
making blunders. As the sea officers are so subject
to be seen by foreigners, what conclusions
must they draw of Americans in general, from
characters so rude and contracted? In my
judgment the abilities of sea officers ought to
be as far superior to the abilities of officers in
the army as the nature of a sea service is more
complicated and admits of a greater number of
cases than can possibly happen on the land;
therefore the discipline by sea ought to be the
more perfect and regular, were it compatible
with short enlistments.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On June 14, 1777, Jones was assigned to the
command of the little cruiser <i>Ranger</i>, just completed
at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. On the
same day Congress established the Stars and
Stripes as the national flag, and it is said, and is
probable, that Jones was the first to hoist this
flag on a man-of-war. His ship was but 116 feet
overall and 28 feet broad. She mounted eighteen
6-pounders.</p>

<p>The delay in fitting out is not to the credit
of the energy of those charged with providing
the ship&#8217;s equipment. The sails were not ready
until late in October. With a crew of about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
one hundred and forty, &#8220;nearly all full-blooded
Yankees,&#8221; she sailed on November 1st, for France,
carrying dispatches from Congress and taking
two prizes on the way. Jones arrived at Nantes
on December 2, 1777.</p>

<p>He had a long wait in France before he again
got to sea, but his frequent consultations with
our commissioners, his always excellent advice
in naval matters, and his general activity were
worth the delay. It was not until April 10th
that he got to sea, starting on his famous cruise
in the Irish Sea during which he took a number
of prizes, among them the <i>Drake</i>, a sloop-of-war
carrying twenty 6-pounders. He landed
at Whitehaven, Scotland, and burned a ship,
one of many which he had hoped to destroy in
this port, and made the famous descent upon
Lord Selkirk&#8217;s estate, where his men carried
off the family silver. But Jones had a mutinous
crew, thirsting for booty, and his concession
of plunder was a case of <i>force majeure</i>. He
later redeemed the silver, giving to the crew
several hundred pounds as its valuation as
prize, and returned it to the family. Jones had
had much difficulty with both officers and crew,
partially no doubt through his own roughness
(mentioned in Fanning&#8217;s narrative) toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
former, and particularly through the peculiar
ideas of liberty prevalent, which sometimes went
so far as to claim that the movements of the
ship should be put to a vote.</p>

<p>Jones having arrived at Brest in May, 1778,
with his prize, the <i>Drake</i>, sought a larger command.
He had to wait a year for it. After
many strivings, one was found in the <i>Duc de
Duras</i>, a fourteen-year-old East Indiaman,
which was bought, fitted as a man-of-war, and
renamed the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> in compliment
to Franklin as being the nearest approach in
French to the &#8220;Poor Richard&#8221; of the famous
almanac. The ship was far from meeting requirements,
being slow and weakly built, so
that she finally carried twenty-eight 12 and 9
pounders instead of 18&#8217;s on the gun deck, eight
6&#8217;s on the forecastle, and on the after part of the
lower deck six 18&#8217;s, forty-two guns in all. She
was provided with a mixed crew of Americans,
French, English, a few Scandinavians, and
eighty-three Irish and Scotch, Jones himself
being of the latter by birth. Of the first there
were in the beginning but seventy-nine, chiefly
exchanged prisoners. Later, owing to mutinous
conduct of the British element, many of
these were discharged and replaced by forty-three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
newly arrived Americans just released
from prison, and thirty Portuguese. The total
was 227 officers and seamen, besides 130 French
soldiers placed aboard to serve as marines.</p>

<p>Jones&#8217;s ideas were large: they included the
fitting out of a large French squadron to act in
concert and carrying a considerable number of
troops to make an attack upon the English
coast. This, however, fell through, and a squadron
was organized of the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i>,
42; the <i>Alliance</i>, 32; the <i>Pallas</i>, 32; the <i>Cerf</i>,
cutter, 18, and the <i>Vengeance</i>, brigantine, of 12
guns.</p>

<p>The <i>Alliance</i> had arrived at Brest, twenty-three
days from Boston, carrying Lafayette,
on February 6, 1779. She had an unreliable
crew, with many English and Irish, and a still
more unreliable captain, Landais, who had been
an officer in the French navy. He had been
appointed a captain in the American service
on the recommendation of Silas Deane, who
seemed to have a faculty for making errors of
the kind. Landais was to give much and continuous
trouble.</p>

<p>The squadron did not finally get off until
August 14, 1779. Its orders, prepared by
Franklin, with the advice of Sartine, the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Minister of Marine, were to cruise to the north
of the British islands and after six weeks to go
into the Texel, Holland. There were varying
incidents of capture of prizes, designs to attack
Leith, insubordinations of the French captains,
etc., but on September 23d, when a convoy of
forty vessels accompanied by two men-of-war
was discovered off Flamborough Head, a prominent
point a few miles south of Scarborough,
England, Jones&#8217;s moment had come.</p>

<p>It was not until seven o&#8217;clock in the evening
that the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> came within gunshot
of the larger ship which turned out to be
the <i>Serapis</i>, Captain Richard Pearson, of 50
guns, 18 of which were 18-pounders. She carried
320 men. There then ensued the most remarkable
duel in naval history. Jones was
left unsupported by his accompanying subordinates,
and he went into action short sixteen
of his best men and a lieutenant, Lunt, who had
been sent to secure a prize. The story of
this remarkable battle must of necessity here be
short; the full details must be sought elsewhere.
But short as it must be, there is
enough of it, however baldly told, to stir the
blood.</p>

<p>Jones closed with his antagonist early in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
action, and as they came in contact the two ships
were lashed together by Jones, the stern of the
<i>Serapis</i> being at the bow of the <i>Bonhomme
Richard</i>. The latter&#8217;s main deck battery of 12-pounders
was silenced, two of the old six 18-pounders
on the lower deck had burst, killing
nearly all the guns&#8217; crews. Only three 9-pounders
on the quarter deck could be used,
and one of these had to be shifted from the off
side. The guns of the <i>Serapis</i> were still active,
but her upper deck had been cleared by the
musketry fire from the tops of the <i>Bonhomme
Richard</i>. The latter&#8217;s prisoners (some 200)
were released without orders, and in their fright
that the ship was sinking, willingly worked the
pumps; both ships were frequently afire. The
men in the <i>Bonhomme Richard&#8217;s</i> tops crawled
along the yards into the tops of the <i>Serapis</i> and
dropped hand grenades whenever any one appeared
on deck; these grenades, at times going
down the hatches and exploding on the lower
deck, finally brought about an explosion of
cartridges below which ran from gun to gun.
This went far toward determining the battle.
Meantime the erratic Landais fired three broad-sides,
chiefly to the damage of the <i>Bonhomme
Richard</i>, as the shot holes were found in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
latter&#8217;s unengaged side. There can be little
question that he hoped this ship would surrender
when, with his own unharmed, he would
capture both. Jones&#8217;s doggedness won the day:
at half-past ten Captain Pearson, influenced no
doubt somewhat by the presence of the <i>Alliance</i>,
surrendered. He stated that an incomplete
list of his killed and wounded were forty-nine
of the former and sixty-eight of the latter, or
more than a third of the whole 320. Jones estimated
his loss at about 150, without stating
the proportions.</p>

<p>While this action was going on, the <i>Pallas</i>,
30, Captain Cottineau, had engaged and taken
the <i>Countess of Scarborough</i>, of 20 guns. The
Baltic fleet under convoy was not attacked, as
it should have been by the <i>Alliance</i> or the
<i>Vengeance</i>, a curious instance of inertia and incapacity
or worse, so long as neither chose to
take part in the main action.</p>

<p>Both the <i>Serapis</i> and <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> were
terribly mauled. The latter&#8217;s rudder, stern
frame, and transoms were cut away, and the
sides between the ports were at points driven in.
It was ten next morning before the fires could be
extinguished. On examination it was decided
that it would be impossible to keep the ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
afloat if rough weather should come on (which
in fact was the case), and during the night and
next morning the wounded were removed. The
men who had been brought from the <i>Pallas</i> to
work the pumps were taken off the evening of
the 25th (two days after the battle). Says
Jones:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;They did not abandon her until after nine
o&#8217;clock; the water was then up to the lower deck,
and a little after ten I saw with unexpressible
grief the last of the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i>. No
lives were lost with the ship, but it was impossible
to save the stores of any sort whatever.
I lost even the best part of my clothes, books
and papers; and several of my officers lost all
their clothes and effects.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The masts of the <i>Serapis</i> fell soon after the
surrender, and jury masts were rigged from
spars furnished by the <i>Alliance</i>, all the spare
spars of the <i>Serapis</i> being too badly cut by shot.
On September 26th she was able to steer for
Holland in company with the rest of the squadron,
and on October 3d entered the Texel after
some demur on the part of the Dutch. Though
Jones&#8217;s instructions gave the Texel as the port
to be made at the end of his six weeks&#8217; cruise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
his own wish was to go into Dunkirk and thus
be under the shelter of an ally. The other captains
adhered to the letter of the instructions,
and Jones felt obliged to yield. Much trouble
would have been saved had his views prevailed.
As an offset, however, to such disabilities as
arose from the inability of Jones to dispose of
the <i>Serapis</i>, the anger of the British Government
against the Dutch as to the reception of
the squadron in Dutch waters went far to bringing
later the declaration of war by England
against Holland. Jones was allowed to land his
sick and wounded, who were cared for on an
island in the bay, as were the prisoners, numbering
537, sufficient to release by exchange all the
American seamen who were prisoners in England.</p>

<p>For Jones&#8217;s further history, his having to put
all his ships but the <i>Alliance</i> under the French
flag to avoid the difficulties raised by Great
Britain with Holland; his going in the <i>Alliance</i>
to Lorient, France; the arrival there and sale of
the <i>Serapis</i>; the charges against Landais; his
short cruise in the <i>Alliance</i>; his unjust treatment
by Arthur Lee, by which Landais regained
command of the <i>Alliance</i>; Lee&#8217;s embarkation in
the <i>Alliance</i> for America and the necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
during the voyage of depriving Landais of the
command on account of evident insanity; the
dismissal of Landais from the service; Jones&#8217;s
arrival in command of the <i>Ariel</i> at Philadelphia,
February 18, 1781, after more than three years&#8217;
absence, and his reception of the thanks of
Congress; his appointment to the command of
the new line-of-battle ship <i>America</i> which he
lost through its presentation to France; his return
to Europe, and the rest of his adventurous
career must be read in the many books devoted
to the history of his life, not the least interesting
part of which is to be found in Fanning&#8217;s
graphic narrative. He will always stand out
boldly as one of the most fearless spirits of the
sea, and had he lived in the Napoleonic epoch
he would have been met by Napoleon as a
kindred soul who might have saved him the
great misfortune of Trafalgar, which so changed
the history of Europe and the world.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> activity of American privateers as well as
Continental ships in British waters during
1777-1779 was very great, that of the <i>Reprisal</i>,
<i>Lexington</i>, <i>Dolphin</i>, and <i>Revenge</i> (the first two,
Continental brigs) being particularly notable.</p>

<p>France was at this period (1777) made a basis
for the fitting out of Continental vessels and
privateers, and for the supply of men in a way
which would be far from possible to-day. Captain
Lambert Wickes of the Continental brig
<i>Reprisal</i> and Gustavus Conyngham of the Continental
lugger <i>Surprise</i> and cutter <i>Revenge</i>,
both of which latter were bought and fitted out
by our commissioners in France, were two of
those most active and prominent in the operations
on the British coast. Their names have
come down to this day as specially brave and
adventurous men. The former had cruised
very successfully on our own coast and in the
West Indies in 1776, and had been the first, as
mentioned, to carry a ship of the regular navy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
to Europe, December, 1776, though privateers
had preceded him. Two prizes taken into
Nantes caused strong protests from Great
Britain. The treaty of Utrecht, 1713, expressly
closed the ports of either power to the
enemies of the other, so that the British case
had a very sound basis. Vergennes unquestionably,
before our alliance, had to hold a
course favoring the Americans which was full
of difficulties. The details of the diplomacy
of the moment cannot be entered upon. Suffice
that the <i>Reprisal</i> refitted went to sea early
in 1777, and brought in five prizes to add to
Vergennes&#8217;s difficulties. The British Ambassador,
Stormont, demanded their release. He
was answered that both captor and captured had
been ordered to leave port and were probably
already at sea, to which Stormont was later
able to make reply that the <i>Reprisal</i> was undergoing
repairs at Lorient, and that the five prizes
had been sold. The questions were bandied
to and fro between the American commissioners,
the French Minister, and the British Ambassador,
with the result that the <i>Reprisal</i>
received orders not to cruise near the French
coast, but apparently the prizes remained in
the hands of the purchasers. On May 28th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Wickes sailed in the <i>Reprisal</i> from St. Nazaire
with the Continental brig <i>Lexington</i>, Captain
Henry Johnson, and the cutter <i>Dolphin</i>, Captain
Nicholson, all under Wickes as senior officer,
for a cruise through the Irish Channel. They
were back in St. Malo on June 27th, having
captured twenty prizes, of which three were released
and seven sunk. In July the commissioners
were obliged to give orders that the
<i>Reprisal</i> and <i>Lexington</i> should return directly
to America, for which the <i>Dolphin</i> had already
sailed as a packet, and to cruise no longer in
Europe. They left in September; when only
two days out the <i>Lexington</i> was captured. The
<i>Reprisal</i> was lost on the Newfoundland Banks,
but one man being saved. The loss of her enterprising
captain was keenly felt and deplored.</p>

<p>Gustavus Conyngham had been selected to
command the lugger <i>Surprise</i> fitting at Dunkirk,
and was given one of the commissions, of
which a number had been sent out in blank
signed by Hancock, President of Congress, and
dated March 1, 1777. He got to sea by May
and, returning almost at once with two prizes,
was, on the demand of the British Ambassador,
with most of his crew, put in prison. His vessel
was seized and the prizes released. His commission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
was taken from him and not returned.
Released, he was at once put in command of a
newly purchased cutter, the <i>Revenge</i>, with a crew
of 106 men. He was given a new commission
which was dated May 2, 1777. He cruised off the
coast of Spain with remarkable success and then
went to the West Indies. He was reported to
have captured, by the time of his arrival there,
sixty vessels, twenty-seven of which had been
sent into port and thirty-three sunk or burned.
After cruising successfully in the West Indies he
arrived at Philadelphia on February 21, 1779.
The <i>Revenge</i> was sold, but the purchaser fitted
her out as a privateer with Conyngham in command,
using his Continental commission, dated
May 2, 1777; this nearly caused Conyngham to
lose his life, for he was captured by a British
frigate in April, taken to New York, confined in
irons, and was sent to England under an accusation
of piracy in that his cruise and captures in
the <i>Revenge</i> early in 1777 had been before the
date of this commission. In November, 1779, he
escaped from Mill prison, where he had been confined.
His active career, however, was ended.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>In 1779 occurred one of the great naval disasters
of the war. Some 800 British troops convoyed
by ships-of-war had in June taken possession
of Penobscot Bay to establish there some
of the many loyalists who had gone to Halifax,
their chief refuge during the war. Maine was
then a part of Massachusetts, and it was this
state which took on the burden of dislodging
the enemy. The Navy Board at Boston lent
the <i>Warren</i>, 32; the <i>Providence</i> (sloop), 14; and
the <i>Diligent</i>, 12. These and three state brigantines,
of 14 or 16 guns each, and thirteen
privateers (insured by the state) made up the
naval part. In all they mounted 324 guns and
were manned by over 2,000 men. Captain
Dudley Saltonstall was in chief command.
There were about 1,000 militia commanded by
General Solomon Lovell. This carefully prepared
effort was a complete failure through the
incompetency and want of push of Saltonstall.
Arriving in the bay on July 25, 1779, the attack
on three British vessels present and on the fort
which was now ready was so dilatory and ineffective
that at length, on August 13th, a British
fleet which had had time to come from New
York appeared and drove the American vessels
up the river, where all except two, which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
captured, were burned. The American loss was
474 men. The remainder had to find their way
back with great hardship through the Maine
woods. This humiliating affair cost Massachusetts
a debt estimated at $7,000,000.</p>

<p>The year 1779, however, had been the most
brilliant of the war for the small American navy.
The exploits of John Paul Jones, of Gustavus
Conyngham and Lambert Wickes in European
waters made an undying page of history; nor
should those of our small frigates, the <i>Queen of
France</i>, <i>Deane</i> (later the <i>Hague</i>), <i>Warren</i>, <i>Boston</i>,
and <i>Ranger</i> on our own coasts as well as of
the swarms of privateers in this year (289 of
which were commissioned by Congress alone) and
whose sweeping captures of the enemy&#8217;s commerce
went so far to supply the needs of our
ever-dwindling army, be forgotten.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>American affairs were now (at the beginning
of 1780) at their lowest ebb. The struggle
had lasted nearly five years. It was with difficulty
that an army, nominally of 6,000 men, could
be kept together. The men were &#8220;half-starved,
imperfectly clothed, riotous, and robbing the
country people ... from sheer necessity.
Desertion was continual, from one to two hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
men a month going over to the enemy....
Only a miracle, thought Washington,
could keep America from the humiliation of
seeing her cause upheld solely by foreign arms.
Throughout the land there was a weariness of
war, a desire for peace at any price.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>At least a third of our population is estimated
to have been loyalist, and another third lukewarm.
At several periods there were more
loyalists in the British service than in our own.
Nor was this situation wholly confined to the
army, for in 1779 there were fitted out at New
York one hundred and twenty-one privateers
in British employ, thirty-four of which carried
from twenty to thirty-six guns. The whole
were manned by between 9,000 and 10,000
men.</p>

<p>The navy was reduced almost as much as the
army. The <i>Boston</i>, <i>Providence</i>, <i>Ranger</i>, and
<i>Queen of France</i> had arrived at Charleston on
December 23, 1779. The first three fell into
the hands of the enemy on the surrender of
Charleston on May 11, 1780, and became part
of the British navy, the fourth along with the
South Carolina ships <i>Bricole</i>, 44; the <i>Truite</i>, 26;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
<i>General Moultrie</i>, 20, and <i>Notre Dame</i>, 16, had
been sunk in the river, as also two small French
ships-of-war <i>L&#8217;Aventure</i> and <i>Polacre</i>. There
thus remained in the latter part of 1780 but one
of the original thirteen frigates, the <i>Trumbull</i>,
which with the <i>Dean</i>, <i>Confederacy</i>, <i>Alliance</i>, and
<i>Saratoga</i> (the last a sloop-of-war), formed in this
year the entire Continental navy in service.
The <i>Deane</i> (renamed the <i>Hague</i>) and the <i>Alliance</i>
were the only two of these to survive the
year.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> now unopposed command of the sea
by the British navy and the consequent invasion
and overrunning of the South brought
darkest gloom and despondency to the American
cause.</p>

<p>It was well that Providence had given America
Washington who, when all things seemed to
fail, held firm and carried us to victory. Without
him the nation could not have survived the
throes of birth. Calm and undismayed, he
made up for the inefficiency of Congress, the
lethargy of the states, the discontent of all.
Whatever our national shortcomings&mdash;past,
present, or future&mdash;America can ever be proud
of having produced this king of men, the greatest
character in history. He was, in fact, the
Revolution personified. The war was fought
without even the semblance of a government,
for even the &#8220;Articles of Confederation and
Perpetual Union&#8221; reported on July 12, 1776,
by a committee appointed on June 10th (the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
same day as that on which the committee was
appointed to draft the Declaration of Independence),
were not agreed to by Congress until
November 17, 1777, and a sufficient number of
states under the conditions of these articles did
not ratify the action of Congress until March 1,
1781. Thus nearly six years of war passed
before we had anything approaching a confederacy,
and even then, as Washington well said,
it was &#8220;but a shade without a substance.&#8221;
&#8220;The organized and carefully barricaded impotence
of this scheme of government,&#8221; says
an able authority, &#8220;is probably unequalled in
history, with any nation surviving.&#8221; Congress
could only &#8220;request&#8221; of the several states, and
but too often these requests bore no fruit whatever.
Attendance in Congress lagged, interest
dwindled, and by 1780 but for Washington, so
far as mortal can judge, the Revolution would
have come to a dismal end.</p>

<p>But Washington&#8217;s time of cheer was at hand.
From February, 1779, to March, 1780, Lafayette
was in France and unceasing in his efforts
in support of the American cause. It was
chiefly due to his efforts that on May 2, 1780,
seven line-of-battle ships and three frigates left
Brest under the Chevalier de Ternay, convoying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
thirty-six transports carrying 5,027 troops,
officers and men, under Lieutenant-General
Count de Rochambeau. The enemy had, on
October 25, 1779, withdrawn from Narragansett
Bay to New York fearing an attack by
d&#8217;Estaing&#8217;s great fleet after its operations
against Savannah. The French fleet anchored
at Newport on July 11th.</p>

<p>The death of de Ternay in December, due,
in Lafayette&#8217;s judgment, to despondency caused
by his hopeless view of things; the treason of
Arnold which came to light in September; the
blockade for most of the coming winter of the
French squadron by, now, a superior British
force; the arrival in the West Indies at the end
of April, 1781, of the Count de Grasse with a
powerful addition to the French fleet; the information
that he expected to come on to the
American coast; the pressing messages to him
from Washington and Rochambeau to hasten
his departure; the reply received on August 14th
that he would sail on August 13th for the Chesapeake
with 3,300 troops, artillery, and siege
guns, and 1,200,000 livres (francs) in money,
determined the move of the small allied armies
to Virginia, where Cornwallis, now some months
in that state, was finally to take up an entrenched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
position at Yorktown, his move from
Portsmouth being completed on August 22d.</p>

<p>The American and French armies, after a
whole year&#8217;s inaction, joined on July 6, 1781,
taking position on a line from Dobbs&#8217; Ferry to
the Bronx. The Fates were surely with America.
Everything conspired for the allies&#8217; success; the
position taken had convinced Clinton that New
York was to be attacked; he pressed Cornwallis
to send him every man he could spare, but
Cornwallis could spare none. Rodney in the
West Indies, misinformed as to De Grasse&#8217;s intentions,
and thinking he was to take but half
his fleet instead of the whole, detached but fourteen
of his own command to go north under Sir
Samuel Hood to reinforce Admiral Graves at
New York. Rodney himself left for England
on leave of absence, carrying four ships with
him. The two vessels dispatched to Graves
with information of British intentions never
reached him. He was east with his squadron
when one, arriving at New York, was sent on to
him but was driven ashore on Long Island by
a superior force and destroyed; the other and
more important one, giving word of Hood&#8217;s
departure, was captured. For this reason,
though Graves returned to New York on August<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
16th, he still remained in the dark as to Hood&#8217;s
movements. The whole was a marvel of good
fortune for the Americans, while every move of
De Grasse&#8217;s fleet and of the allied armies were
to fit with the perfection of mechanism.</p>

<p>Hood left the West Indies on August 10th.
On the 25th he looked into the Chesapeake
and, finding nothing, went on to Sandy Hook,
where he arrived August 28th. That same
evening word was received that De Barras (who
had arrived from France as the successor of De
Ternay) had sailed from Newport with his whole
division of eight of the line, four frigates, and
eighteen transports. It was now known to
the British general that the allied armies were
on their way south and that De Grasse was
bound for the Chesapeake. Graves, with five
of the line and a 50-gun ship, all that could be
got ready in the time, joined Hood off Sandy
Hook on August 31st and started south. He
had nineteen ships-of-the-line to De Grasse&#8217;s
twenty-eight. But De Grasse was already inside
the capes, which he had reached on August
30th, and was at anchor in Lynnhaven Bay, just
within Cape Henry. He had at once landed his
troops and had stationed cruisers in James
River to prevent Cornwallis attempting to escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
to North Carolina. His dispositions reduced
his available ships to twenty-four of the
line. At this moment Washington &#8220;was crossing
the Delaware on his way south, with 6,000
regular troops, 2,000 American and 4,000
French, to join Lafayette,&#8221; who now, with the
3,300 French from the fleet, had 8,000 regulars
and militia.</p>

<p>On September 5th Admiral Graves&#8217;s fleet was
sighted by the French in the northeast. It was
at first thought to be that of De Barras, but, on
discovering the mistake, De Grasse took a course
which risked all by getting under way and going
outside the capes to fight a battle. To get
twenty-four heavy sailing ships under way and
attempt to get them in any formation in a reasonable
time, even with the ebb tide which was
running, was, with the wind north-northeast, a
difficult operation. Several had to tack in
order to clear Cape Henry, and by the time they
reached the open sea the French ships must
have been in very straggling condition. Graves
failed to take advantage of such an opportunity.
Instead of crowding sail, with a wind as fair as
he could wish, and pressing down for the French,
whom he might have attacked in detail, he
formed a line heading out to sea, to fight a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
battle, partially under the old rule of parallel
columns with each ship engaging her opposite,
and partially under new ideas of tactics which
Graves, just from England, had imbibed but
which most of his captains had scarcely heard
of.</p>

<p>The action began about four o&#8217;clock, signals
were not understood, and, taken all in all, the
handling of the British fleet was badly botched.
Furthermore, Sir Samuel Hood, who commanded
the rear division and was an officer of highest
reputation, showed no initiative such as, in the
circumstances, might have been expected, his
division getting scarcely into gunshot. Thus
at sunset, when the battle ceased, the British
were in decidedly the worse plight, with a loss
of 90 killed and 246 wounded, against about
200 killed and wounded of the French, and with
several ships very severely injured, one, the
<i>Terrible</i>, 74, so much so that she was in sinking
condition, and five days later was burned.
Though the two fleets were yet in sight of each
other for four days, neither showed a wish to
renew the action. On September 10th, when
morning broke, the French were out of sight.
Next day they re&euml;ntered the Chesapeake, capturing
near the entrance two frigates sent by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Graves to reconnoitre, one of which was the <i>Iris</i>
which had been the American <i>Hancock</i>. They
found at anchor within the capes the division
of Barras which the day before had arrived
from Newport with the siege artillery intended
for use at Yorktown. On the 13th the British
fleet stood in for the capes and sighted the
French at anchor. There was nothing to do
but to return north. On the 19th it was again
at Sandy Hook, and American independence
was won.</p>

<p>Washington had not heard until September
5th of De Grasse&#8217;s arrival. &#8220;Standing on the
river bank at Chester, he waved his hat in the
air as the Comte de Rochambeau approached,
and with many demonstrations of uncontrollable
happiness he announced to him the good
news.&#8221; Had he known that at that moment
De Grasse was under way to go to sea and fight
a battle, he would have been less joyous. For
it was only the want of initiative on the part of
the British admiral that saved the situation.
For had the latter at any time in the six days
which the French spent at sea himself entered
the Chesapeake, he could have held the position,
and De Grasse&#8217;s venture would have gone
for nought. It is highly improbable that in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
circumstances de Grasse would have shown such
initiative as to attack New York. It is clear
that neither admiral had a clear sense of the
strategy involved, for De Grasse himself but a
little later was again desirous of leaving the
Chesapeake to seek the British fleet, and was
only held by the most earnest remonstrances of
Washington. As it was, the army was transported
by September 26th to Williamsburg, and
on October 19th Lord Cornwallis surrendered,
thus, virtually, closing the war. De Grasse sailed
November 4th to the West Indies and to ruin;
for on April 12, 1782, he was signally defeated by
Rodney and became a prisoner.</p>

<p>The French army was an aid to our success;
the French navy was a necessity. The result
completely filled the dictum of Washington,
who foresaw by a hundred years that which is
to-day an axiom and one particularly applicable
to our own country: &#8220;In any operation and under
all circumstances, a decisive naval superiority
is to be considered a fundamental principle
and the basis upon which every hope of success
must ultimately depend.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He would have
made a great admiral, a career he narrowly escaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
when it was proposed that he should go
as midshipman under Admiral Vernon. The
Fates fortunately decreed otherwise.</p>

<p>The operations of the Continental navy were
now confined to very few ships. The <i>Alliance</i>,
under Captain Barry, had left Boston February
11, 1781, carrying Colonel John Laurens and
Thomas Paine. The former bore a letter which,
addressed by Washington to Laurens, was to be
shown Vergennes, putting strongly the necessity
of money and ships, and giving the whole
logic of the situation in the sentence: &#8220;Indeed,
it is not to be conceived how [the British] could
subsist a large force in this country if we had the
command of the seas to interrupt the regular
transmission of supplies from Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Alliance</i> was unhappy in the character
of her crew, which illustrated the exigencies to
which we were now driven. A large number
were British prisoners. These on the return
voyage formed a conspiracy to carry the ship to
Ireland, in the suppression of which Barry exhibited
courage and qualities for command of a
high order. On the way he captured two British
cruisers, of 16 and 14 guns, the smaller of
which was made a cartel to carry his prisoners,
now about 250, into Halifax. The larger was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
retaken by a squadron near Cape Cod. The
<i>Marquis de Lafayette</i>, a French privateer which
had left France at the same time as the <i>Alliance</i>,
with a valuable cargo of military stores, suffered
the same fate.</p>

<p>The <i>Deane</i>, <i>Confederacy</i>, and <i>Saratoga</i> cruised
this year in the West Indies, with small fortune,
which was turned into very bad, by the capture
of the <i>Confederacy</i> by a British squadron on
April 15th. The <i>Trumbull</i>, at sea on her first
cruise, with a mixed crew of wretched quality,
was dismasted in a gale and was taken on August
8th by the <i>Iris</i> and the <i>General Monk</i>, both of
which were captured American ships taken into
the British service, one, as just said, being the
<i>Hancock</i>, and the latter a privateer, the <i>General
Washington</i>. The <i>Iris</i>, as but just mentioned
above, was taken by the French only a month
later and the <i>General Monk</i> on April 7th of the
next year by the <i>Hyder Ally</i>, under Captain
Joshua Barney, in one of the notable actions
of the war.</p>

<p>Up to the peace signed September 3, 1783,
privateering had continued active, 383 letters
of marque being granted by Congress in 1782,
but the Continental navy had practically disappeared.
There were but five ships remaining:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the frigates <i>Alliance</i>, <i>Hague</i>, and <i>Bourbon</i>
(the last not yet launched), and the ships <i>General
Washington</i> and <i>Duc de Lauzun</i>. Only the
first two were in commission. Our only line-of-battle
ship, the newly launched <i>America</i>, had
been given to France to replace the <i>Magnifique</i>,
wrecked coming into Boston harbor. The few
ships mentioned gradually disappeared: the <i>Duc
de Lauzun</i> was sent to France as a transport and
sold; the <i>Bourbon</i>, launched at Middletown,
Connecticut, July 31, 1783, was advertised for
sale two months later, as was the <i>Hague</i> in
August; the <i>General Washington</i> was sold the
next year. Sentiment preserved the <i>Alliance</i>
until August, 1785, when, with her sale, the Continental
navy passed into history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To recapitulate some data of the first chapter:</p>

<p>The British navy had at the beginning of the
war 270 ships, of which 131 were of the line
(from 100 to 60 guns), and but 18,000 seamen.
At the end, January 20, 1783, there were 468
ships, of which 174 were of the line, and 110,000
seamen. They had lost (taken, destroyed,
burned, foundered, or wrecked) 202 ships carrying
5,130 guns. The Continental and state
navies had lost (taken, destroyed, burned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
foundered, or wrecked) 39 ships, carrying 876
guns. The French had lost (in all the ways just
mentioned) 72 ships, with 2,636 guns; the
Spanish 24, with 960 guns; the Dutch 9, with
364 guns.</p>

<p>The British during the war lost 3,087 merchant
vessels, taken by Americans, French,
Dutch, and Spanish; 879 of these were retaken
or ransomed. They lost 89 privateers, of which
14 were retaken or ransomed. They captured
1,135 merchantmen, of which only 27 were retaken
or ransomed, and 216 privateers, of which
only one was retaken.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The net result was heavily
against them.</p>

<p>The navy of the Revolution, however insufficient
and ineffective as an instrument of real
war, served a good purpose. It kept up our communication
with Europe; made many captures
of material in ordnance, ammunition, and stores
of utmost importance to our forces, and fought
many gallant actions. But actions between
small cruisers and captures of merchantmen are
not the means which bring control of the sea.
The action of greatest moment was that of the
little flotilla on Lake Champlain in 1776, and
this, even though defeated, was a main instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
in gaining the French alliance and thus
our independence. It is the battleship, in that
day known as the ship-of-the-line, which decides
the question of command of the world&#8217;s highway
and thus decides the outcome of war between
powers separated by the ocean. The services of
the small Continental navy thus from the very
nature of things could effect comparatively little
so long as the ship-of-the-line could go and come
as it pleased. It was the French battleship in larger
numbers than the English that completely
changed the melancholy outlook of 1780 and
1781. In July of the latter year Rochambeau,
in a letter to De Grasse urging him to come
north, could use the words: &#8220;General Washington
has but a handful of men.... This
country has been driven to bay and all its resources
are giving out at once.&#8221; He told but the
painful fact. The presence of a dominating
fleet gave us victory and independence; without
it the Revolution would have failed. It took
us a hundred years to realize the truth of the
principle here stated, and we have yet to frame
a policy in accord with its meaning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With the passing of the ships passed all semblance
of naval organization. The Board of Admiralty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
had really consisted of Robert Morris
only, and the Congress of the loosely bound Confederation
was itself almost moribund. The
United States found itself free, but it was
the freedom of disorganization, an atrophy of
government. The Revolution had been fought
until March, 1781, without an established government.
This is a remarkable fact. We had
yet to wait four years from the peace for a real
instrument of government, the Constitution of
1787. The adoption of this on September 13,
1787, was the true birthday of the Republic
rather than the 4th of July, 1776. The Revolution
of 1787 was quite as momentous as that
of the war just ended.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Stretching</span> along the southern shore of the
Mediterranean some 1,800 miles, in the latitude,
roughly speaking, of Cape Hatteras, are the regions
known to our forefathers as Barbary. The
westernmost was Morocco, then Algiers, Tunis,
and Tripoli. The last three were nominally appanages
of the Turkish Empire. Anciently
there had been along these shores a high civilization.
Carthage (now Tunis) had disputed with
Rome the empire of the Mediterranean; she
failed through Rome&#8217;s final dominancy at sea,
and her power was utterly wrecked, as was the
city itself. Rome ruled and built thriving cities
throughout the coastline mentioned, the remains
of which now mark but dimly the footsteps
of civilization and history.</p>

<p>With the rise of Mohammedanism, the Arab
power swept westward over the entire region.
The antagonism of religion brought a continuous
warfare between the European and African
shores which developed into a piracy which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
lasted almost to our own days. A relic of the
fear which Europe had for these bold corsairs,
who captured vessels of all nations and carried
crews and passengers into cruel slavery, is in the
many towers of refuge still along the French and
Italian rivieras, and the memory is yet in the
Litany in the prayer-book of the Episcopal
Church in England and America, where we pray
for &#8220;all prisoners and captives.&#8221; Long after the
writer entered our navy, the Saturday evening
toast, after &#8220;Sweethearts and Wives,&#8221; was,
&#8220;Here&#8217;s to the downfall of the barbarous Moor.&#8221;
It was an echo of the epic period of the American
navy. For we once did great things in Barbary,
of which the average American to-day (and more&#8217;s
the pity) is almost wholly ignorant. It is in its
earlier phase a tale of national humiliation in
which all Europe also had full share, but in which
our navy had no part; its later phase in which
the navy came into action is a very proud story.</p>

<p>The depredations of the Barbary powers were
not confined to the Mediterranean, but extended
into the North and Irish seas, many inhabitants
being carried from these coasts into slavery.
There were various efforts to punish these raiding
powers in the seventeenth century by Dutch,
French, and English, and as late as 1775 a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
expedition was fitted out by Spain of nearly four
hundred vessels, against Algiers, which, however,
ended in disaster. This has special interest
to us, as Joshua Barney, who was to act a conspicuous
part in our naval annals, was impressed,
with the Baltimore ship which he commanded,
to assist in the transport of troops.</p>

<p>The Barbary vessels were in general large,
narrow rowboats, carrying usually two masts,
with the lateen sail of the Mediterranean for
use in fair winds. The name &#8220;galley&#8221; was applied
in Europe to the largest of such in ordinary
use. There was, however, a much larger development
in the galleasse, some few of which, used by
the Neapolitans, carried 700 men, 300 of whom
would be convicts at the oars. There was finally
the galleon, the precursor of the frigate, which
had masts and sails alone for propulsion. In
the large galleys there might be as many as six
men at an oar. It may be said that in general the
development of the corsair ship followed slowly
but fairly closely that of the ship of Europe,
and in later years they had a number of the
usual square-rigged vessels.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The Christian slaves were employed not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
in the galleys, but did all kinds of labor; the
crew of our frigate <i>Philadelphia</i>, which in 1803
grounded near Tripoli and thus was captured,
was employed in building one of the defences
against our own ships, which took the name of
the American fort. In the main, however, the
captivity was humane and not oppressive.</p>

<p>The claim of the Barbary powers was expressed
in a statement of their envoy while in
London in 1786, to our minister, John Adams:
&#8220;That Turkey, Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco
were the sovereigns of the Mediterranean;
and that no nation could navigate that sea without
a treaty of peace with them.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Europe had
practically accepted a situation of the most degrading
kind; every nautical power paid tribute
in money or presents and all had representatives
among the Barbary slaves. Even as late as
1816, when the English finally acted, there were
eighteen Englishmen among the slaves released
by Lord Exmouth&#8217;s expedition.</p>

<p>But England&#8217;s attitude had not been one of
honor. There was no time when she might not
have ended the foul situation. Franklin could
say in a letter on July 25, 1783, to our secretary
of foreign affairs: &#8220;I think it not improbable that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
these rovers may be privately encouraged by
the English to fall upon us and to prevent our
interfering in the carrying trade; for I have in
London heard it is a maxim among the merchants,
that if there were no Algiers it would be
worth England&#8217;s while to build one. I wonder,
however, that the rest of Europe do not combine
to destroy those nests and secure commerce
from their future piracies.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Three years later
John Adams, our minister in London, was writing
Secretary Jay (February 17, 1786): &#8220;There
are not wanting persons in England who will
find means to stimulate this African [the Tripolitan
envoy] to stir up his countrymen against
American vessels.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> British statesmanship, then
as ever, was jealous of rival commerce on the
seas. Lord Sheffield, in a pamphlet on American
commerce, could say: &#8220;It will not be in the
interest of any of the great maritime powers to
protect [Americans] from the Barbary States.
If they know their interests, they will not encourage
the Americans to be carriers&mdash;that the
Barbary States are advantageous to the maritime
powers is obvious.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is odd that at this period two men whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
lives were of a sort that one would have supposed
they would have advised each directly
otherwise, exchanged characters. Thus while
Thomas Jefferson, our minister to France, advised
in 1785 force as the best protection, John
Adams in England, influenced perhaps by his
surroundings, advised following the usual plan
of paying an annual tribute. Jefferson later,
most unhappily for his country, was violently
antagonistic to the establishment of a navy.
Adams was, and always had been, quite the reverse.
But he now felt that the country was
too poor and too embarrassed by debt to use
force. He wrote John Jay, Foreign Secretary,
December 15, 1784: &#8220;As long as France,
England, Holland, the Emperor, etc., will submit
to be tributaries to these robbers and even
encourage them, to what purpose should we
make war upon them? The resolution might be
heroic but would not be wise ... we cannot
hurt them in the smallest degree....
Unless it were possible, then, to persuade the
great maritime powers of Europe to unite in the
suppression of these piracies, it would be very
imprudent for us to entertain any thoughts of
contending with them.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>The two ministers had an extended correspondence,
and though Adams said: &#8220;I will go
all lengths with you in promoting a navy,
whether it be applied to the Algerines or not,&#8221; he
still doubted the economy of dealing with Barbary
by force. Jefferson&#8217;s tone was now, for him,
strangely combative. He wrote, August 20, 1785:
&#8220;The question is whether their peace or war will
be cheapest? But it is a question which should
be addressed to our honor as well as our avarice,
nor does it respect us as to these pirates only,
but as to the nations of Europe. If we wish our
commerce to be free and uninsulted, we must
let these nations see that we have an energy
which at present they disbelieve. The low opinion
they entertain of our powers cannot fail to
involve us soon in a naval war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jefferson&#8217;s views involved an association
which would furnish one or more cruisers each
to act against piracy in the Mediterranean. It
included Portugal, Naples, the two Sicilies,
Venice, Malta, Denmark, and Sweden, an extremely
difficult combination; but he doubted
the good faith of others. In a letter to Monroe,
August 11, 1786, he says: &#8220;I think every power
in Europe would soon fall into it except France,
England, and perhaps Spain and Holland. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
these there is only England who would give any
real aid to the Algerines....&#8221; He
added: &#8220;Were the honor and advantage of establishing
such a confederacy out of the question,
yet the necessity that the United States should
have some marine force, and the happiness of
this, as the ostensible cause of beginning it,
would decide on its propriety. It will be said
there is no money in the treasury. There never
will be money in the treasury till the confederacy
shows its teeth.... Every rational
citizen must wish to see an effective instrument
of coercion and should fear to see it on any other
element than the water. A naval force can never
endanger our liberties nor occasion bloodshed; a
land force would do both.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>This was Jefferson at his best. It is extraordinary
that when the time came to really assert
ourselves against the seizure of our seamen and
property by other powers than those of Barbary,
he should have so completely failed. But in any
case, at the time he was proposing his floating
confederacy, our inchoate system of government
of the period, which required each state to be
solicited by Congress for funds, would no doubt,
as Adams thought, have made it impossible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
provide the needed ships. Our vessels continued
to be seized and their crews enslaved.</p>

<p>It would be unjust to the memory of John
Adams, to whom the Continental navy chiefly
owed its beginnings, and who was ever the vigorous
supporter of the newer navy, not to record
his life-long views as expressed to the House of
Representatives in November, 1800: &#8220;I confidently
believe that few persons can be found
within the United States who do not admit that
a navy, well-organized, must constitute the
natural and efficient defence of this country
against all foreign hostility.&#8221; To this he was
consistent through the whole of his long life. In
1785 he was simply doubtful of the travesty of
government which then existed and was to have
two more years of its ineffective life.</p>

<p>In January, 1791, the United States, having
now through its newly formed Constitution of
1787 crystallized into a real nationality, the
Senate Committee on Mediterranean Trade
agreed that our trade could &#8220;be protected but
by a naval force, and that it will be proper to resort
to the same as soon as the state of the public
finances will admit.&#8221; But a year later the Senate
was stating its &#8220;readiness to ratify treaties with
Algiers providing for peace at a cost of forty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
thousand dollars at the outset and annual tribute
of twenty-five thousand; and also for the
ransom of the captives, then thirteen in number,
for forty thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fifty thousand dollars was appropriated to
begin with, and Paul Jones was appointed consul
at Algiers and as our envoy to make a peace.
But Jones died at Paris, July 18, 1792. Thomas
Barclay, our consul in Morocco, was appointed;
he also died very shortly, and David Humphreys,
our minister to Portugal, succeeded him. But
the Dey of Algiers refused to receive him. The
seizures continued, and in 1793 eleven vessels
were captured and the crews enslaved. There
were now in Algiers over a hundred American
captives. The English consul, who of course
was acting on orders from home, was blamed by
Humphreys for the situation. Finally the House
resolved on January 2, 1792, but only by a majority
of two, that a naval force should be provided.
A bill providing for six ships at a cost of
$600,000 was finally passed with a proviso that
if peace could be arranged with Algiers work on
these should stop. There had been much opposition,
many arguing &#8220;that we should follow the
example of Europe by buying peace, or should
hire a European navy to protect our trade; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
a navy was a menace to liberty....&#8221; Madison
opposed the bill, partly on the ground that
a navy would lead to international complications,
particularly with England, and this opinion
was shared by others. The opposition
was chiefly from the South, the New England
members, who represented a constituency which
was suffering from the depredations, naturally
favored the action. The bill provided for four
ships to carry forty-four guns and two to carry
thirty-six each, with full complements, pay, and
rations, and $688,888.82 was finally voted. The
date of the approval of this bill, March 27, 1794,
marks the establishment of the American navy.
Joshua Humphreys of Philadelphia was the fortunate
selection as naval architect. His view
was that these ships should be the most powerful
of their class afloat, and this was finally supported
by General Knox, the Secretary of War,
whose department was for some years to control
the navy.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this action, we continued
the negotiation of a treaty with Algiers, Thomas
Humphreys being authorized July 19, 1794, to
spend $800,000 (the cost of two ships-of-the-line)
to effect it. Washington was at this time
President, and Jefferson Secretary of State. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
treaty was concluded after much insulting conduct
on the part of the Dey, on September 5,
1795, and only on the offer, as an additional present,
of a 36-gun frigate. It was ratified by the
Senate on March 6, 1796, and had &#8220;cost up to
January, 1797, nearly a million dollars, including
$525,000 for ransom of the captives, various
presents, and miscellaneous expenses; this was
exclusive of the annuity in naval stores valued
at something over $21,000, according to the estimate,
which afterward proved far too low.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Truly weakness came high.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the proviso of cessation of
building in case a treaty should be made, Washington&#8217;s
advice to continue the building of the
ships was accepted by Congress, and in 1797
there were launched the <i>United States</i>, the <i>Constitution</i>,
and <i>Constellation</i>, all to become famous
in our country&#8217;s history. The last two are still
afloat and their old age proudly cared for.</p>

<p>In his annual message of December, 1796,
Washington urged a naval force as indispensable,
saying: &#8220;To secure respect to a neutral
flag requires a naval force, organized and ready
to vindicate it from insult or aggression. This
may even prevent the necessity of going to war<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
by discouraging belligerent powers from committing
such violations of the rights of the neutral
party as may, first or last, leave no other
option.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following, which illustrates the result of
the meanness of spirit in Congress, is scarcely
pleasant reading for an American to-day. Says
the Portsmouth newspaper of January 20, 1798:
&#8220;On Thursday morning, about sunrise, a gun
was discharged from the <i>Crescent</i> frigate as a
signal for getting under way, and at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
she cleared the harbor with a fine leading breeze.
Our best wishes follow Captain Newman, his
officers and men. May they arrive in safety at
the place of their destination and present to the
Dey of Algiers one of the finest specimens of
naval architecture which was ever borne upon
Piscataqua&#8217;s waters.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Blow all ye winds that fill the prosperous sail,</div>
<div class="verse">And hush&#8217;d in peace be every adverse gale.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Crescent</i> is a present from the United
States to the Dey as a compensation for delay
in not fulfilling our treaty stipulations in proper
time[!]...</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Crescent</i> has many valuable presents on
board for the Dey, and when she sailed was supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
to be worth at least three hundred thousand
dollars. Twenty-six barrels of dollars
constituted a part of her cargo. It is worthy of
remark that the captain, chief of the officers, and
many of the privates of the <i>Crescent</i> frigate have
been prisoners at Algiers.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>There must be few Americans who do not
blush for the want of public spirit which in this
ship was so concretely exhibited.</p>

<p>A treaty had been concluded with Tripoli in
November, 1796, at a cost of nearly fifty-six
thousand dollars, and one arranged with Tunis
in August, 1797, at an estimated expense of one
hundred and seven thousand dollars, but these
estimates were much increased by our yielding
to later demands. This treaty, finally concluded
March 26, 1797, was ratified by our Senate on
January 10, 1800. Its conclusion was due
largely to the efforts of William Eaton, who had
been appointed consul to Tunis in July, 1797.
He held true views of the situation. &#8220;The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
United States set out wrongly and has proceeded
so. Too many concessions have been
made to Algiers. There is but one language
which can be held to these people and this is
<i>terror</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eaton, born in Connecticut in 1764, was a
Revolutionary soldier at sixteen, a graduate
later of Dartmouth College, and in 1792 a captain
in the army. He was a most interesting character
whom it would have been well, on account
of his bold and active spirit, to have put in entire
control of our diplomatic affairs in Barbary. We
shall hear of him later.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> depredations of the new French Republic
had come to give an impetus to our new navy,
and on April 27, 1798, $950,000 was appropriated
for its increase, and a regular navy department
created. Benjamin Stoddart, of
Georgetown, in the District of Columbia, was the
first secretary. War against France was formally
declared, in so far as authorizing, on July 9,
1798, the capture of French ships, and authorizing
the President to issue commissions for privateers.
On the same day a marine corps of 881
of all ranks was established, to be commanded
by a major. By July 16th the total force authorized
then and previously was twelve frigates,
twelve sloops-of-war from 20 to 24 guns, six
smaller sloops, besides galleys and revenue cutters;
a total of thirty.</p>

<p>The first ship to get to sea under the new organization
was the <i>Ganges</i>, a purchased Indiaman,
which sailed under command of Captain
Richard Dale on May 22, 1798, on a coasting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
cruise with orders to capture all French cruisers
on our coast with hostile intent. The <i>Constellation</i>,
38, Captain Truxton, and <i>Delaware</i>, 20,
Captain Decatur, followed in June. The last
made the first capture, a French privateer of 14
guns and 70 men. She was condemned and
bought into the navy under the name of <i>Retaliation</i>,
with Lieutenant Bainbridge in command.
The <i>United States</i>, 44, Captain Barry, went to
sea early in July, followed by the <i>Constitution</i>,
44, on the 20th, with four revenue brigs of from
10 to 14 guns each. There were at sea in all, in
1798, fifteen ships of the navy and eight revenue
vessels, many of which latter were finally taken
into the navy. It is worthy of note that one of
these, the <i>Pickering</i>, was Preble&#8217;s first command.</p>

<p>All of these vessels except the <i>George Washington</i>,
<i>Merrimack</i>, and <i>Ganges</i>, the <i>Montezuma</i>,
<i>Baltimore</i>, and <i>Delaware</i>, and the <i>Herald</i>, <i>Richmond</i>,
and <i>Retaliation</i> were built by the Government.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>One of the first affairs of the new navy was
a notable case of impressment of British seamen
from the <i>Baltimore</i>, acting as convoy to a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
of merchantmen. Meeting a powerful British
squadron off Havana, Captain Phillips of the
<i>Baltimore</i> was informed by the British commodore
of his intention to remove all British seamen
from his ship. Phillips announced his intention
of surrendering his ship rather than to
submit to the outrage. Unfortunately there was
a lawyer on board as passenger, and Phillips
asked his judgment as to the legality of the British
commander&#8217;s procedure. Had Phillips acted
as he at first intended, viz.: to resist to the utmost,
short of an engagement which would have
been folly against three line-of-battle ships, he
would have done well, but his legal friend found
reasons for yielding, which was done. Five men
were taken, and three ships of the convoy seized,
for what actual reason Cooper, who gives this
case in great detail, does not say. Phillips was
handicapped by his inexperience as a naval officer,
having been only just appointed into the
navy from the merchant service. There were,
too, dissentient opinions even among patriotic
Americans of standing as to the justice of the
British claims, many upholding the, then, British
doctrine of inalienable allegiance. Even so
considerable a person as Gouverneur Morris,
one of the ablest men America has produced and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
of large diplomatic and political experience,
maintained the view. It was the first of many
cases which had so large a part in bringing on the
War of 1812.</p>

<p>In November the <i>Retaliation</i> was captured by
a French squadron, and Bainbridge was a prisoner
for the first, though not for the last, time in
his career. By the good fortune of the release
of his schooner as a cartel he was enabled to return
home.</p>

<p>During 1799 we had twenty-eight vessels in
active service. Most of the captains and many
of the officers of lesser rank were men who had
seen service during the Revolution, which, it
must be remembered, had ended but sixteen years
before; many of them of course were men with
no experience of naval life, which differs from
that of the merchant service much as does that
of the raw militiaman from that of the seasoned
soldier.</p>

<p>There was a squadron of ten ships under Commodore
Barry, with his broad-pennant in the
<i>United States</i>; a second of five under Captain
Truxton in the <i>Constellation</i>; and a third of three
under Captain Tingey. A number of French
privateers were captured by each, but on February
8, 1799, the <i>Constellation</i> sighted near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
island of Nevis the French frigate <i>L&#8217;Insurgente</i>,
of forty 12-pounders and 409 men, which, after a
hot action of an hour, surrendered. The <i>Constellation</i>
carried 38 guns, those on her main deck
being 24-pounders, and a crew of only 309. She
was, however, distinctly superior in weight of
gunfire. Among her midshipmen was David
Porter of future fame, who was to be the father
of an even more famous son. The <i>Insurgente</i>
was carried into St. Kitts under very difficult
circumstances by Lieutenant Rodgers, later one
of the navy&#8217;s worthies, and the progenitor of a
famous family with now its sixth successive generation
in the naval service.</p>

<p>It was now, in 1799, that Preble, promoted to
be a captain and in command of the <i>Essex</i>, 32,
carried the first American man-of-war east of
the Cape of Good Hope. By the beginning of
1800 France was disposed to peace, and on
November 3d the <i>United States</i> sailed with the
American envoys.</p>

<p>The victory of the <i>Constellation</i> had warmed
the American blood, and Congress in 1800 appropriated
$2,482,593.90 for the naval service.
This strictly naval war had now lasted a year
and a half, and during 1800 we had thirty-five
ships in the West Indies. Again the <i>Constellation</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and under the same captain, was the lucky
ship. On February 1, 1800, she sighted off Guadaloupe
a French frigate, <i>La Vengeance</i>, of 52
guns, which, deep with valuables which she was
transporting to France, tried to avoid action.
This, however, after a chase extending into the
evening of the next day, was brought on, and
lasted until 1:00 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> of the 3d, when the French
frigate hauled by the wind. In the endeavor to
follow, the <i>Constellation&#8217;s</i> mainmast, every shroud
of which had been shot away, went by the board
despite the efforts to repair damages, carrying
with it midshipman Jarvis and the topmen aloft,
all but one of whom were lost. The <i>Constellation</i>
had fourteen men killed and twenty-five wounded,
eleven of whom died later of their wounds. Her
quarry got into Cura&ccedil;ao dismasted and in a
sinking condition with fifty killed and one hundred
and ten wounded. The engagement had
lasted five hours within pistol shot.</p>

<p>These brilliant actions not only brought
Truxton a gold medal from Congress and a great
name, but greatly increased the popularity of
the navy, service in which was now sought by
the best young manhood of the country.</p>

<p>There were many other successes in this year
which included the capture of nearly fifty privateers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
for the detail of which there is no space;
but one of these actions, the cutting out of a
French privateer, the <i>Sandwich</i>, in Puerto Plata,
Santo Domingo, is notable as being brilliantly
carried out by Isaac Hull, the first lieutenant of
the <i>Constitution</i>, and who, as captain of the same
ship twelve years later, was to capture the
<i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>.</p>

<p>The only other capture of special note was
that of the French cruiser <i>Le Berceau</i>, &#8220;a singularly
fine vessel of her class,&#8221; by the <i>Boston</i>,
on October 12, 1800, which was returned to
France under the treaty of peace which had already
been signed on September 30th.</p>

<p>The year involved some sea losses. The <i>Insurgente</i>,
which had been taken into the service,
sailed in July and was never again heard of; the
<i>Pickering</i> sailed in August to a like fate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ending of the war with France was but to
find, shortly, another on our hands, for which
the former, however, was an admirable preparation
at a minimum cost; for it had caused provision
of the absolute essentials to meet the new
emergency: ships, officers, and men. The lesson
to be learned was, however, largely to be
disregarded by those now to come into political
power.</p>

<p>Fenimore Cooper began the seventeenth chapter
of his classic history of the navy by some
words of political wisdom which are applicable
to this day, and apparently always will be:
&#8220;Every form of government,&#8221; he says, &#8220;has
evils peculiar to itself. In a democracy there
exists a standing necessity for reducing everything
to the average comprehension, the high
intelligence of a nation usually conceding as
much to its ignorance as it imparts. One of the
worst consequences in a practical sense, of this
compromise of knowledge, is to be found in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
want of establishments that require foresight
and liberality to be well managed, for the history
of every democracy has shown that it has
been deficient in the wisdom which is dependent
on those expenditures that foster true economy,
by anticipating evils and avoiding the waste of
precipitation, want of system, and a want of
knowledge.&#8221; In every epoch of difficulty&mdash;the
French spoliations, the British impressments,
the War of 1812, the Mexican War, our Civil
War, and the Spanish War&mdash;this truth has been
painfully apparent in the want of foresight and
preparation of an adequate army and navy. It
has cost us dear.</p>

<p>In 1801 came into power a new political school
of which Jefferson was the great exponent. With
strong French sympathies, he had not favored
the naval war with France, and his party was
bent upon naval economy. Thus an early act
of his administration, which began March 4,
1801, was to carry into effect a law passed
toward the close of the Congress which had just
expired, it is true, but which had been elected
under the new political inspiration. The law
referred to empowered the President to sell all
or any of the vessels of the navy with the exception
of thirteen frigates, and obliged him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
reduce the list of officers to nine captains, thirty-six
lieutenants, and one hundred and fifty midshipmen.
The selling of twenty of the smaller
ships was not so great an evil in itself, as new
ordnance was coming into use and small guns
of light calibre, carrying balls from six to nine
and twelve pounds, were being superseded by
carronades&mdash;short guns with thin walls and very
small charges. They were of two calibres, 32
and 24 pounders. The former with a powder
charge of two pounds had a range of about 300
yards. It is evident that at long range the
long gun with a much heavier charge had a
great advantage. The carronade was only fit
for close quarters. This change required vessels
of much stouter build than the light sloops-of-war
such as most of those sold were. But the
mistake was that they were not replaced. The
law of 1798 had authorized the building of six
ships-of-the-line to carry 74 guns each. This
was now unhappily suspended; an error bitterly
to be repented.</p>

<p>It was a period of utmost world unrest when
we were to be ground between the upper and
nether millstones of Napoleonic authority and
British arrogance. Depredations upon our
commerce were constant, not only by Barbary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
corsairs but by highly civilized France and
England which latter also for years impressed
our seamen at will. It was a period when true
statesmanship demanded a powerful naval
force; when but a mere fraction of the losses by
seizure of our merchant marine and of the cost
of the War of 1812 would have built a fleet of
ships-of-the-line and would have saved us both
the spoliation and the war. But Jefferson,
though he had taken the finer stand as to the
Barbary outrages, seemed incapable of understanding
that his views as to these were of universal
application, and that they held good
against Britain and France as well as against
Algiers and Tripoli. He seemed obsessed with
an enmity to any naval force. He expressed
the view that a navy was &#8220;a ruinous folly.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
And in his annual message of December 15,
1802, advised &#8220;to add to our navy yard at
Washington a dock within which our vessels
may be laid up dry and under cover from the
sun.&#8221; Perhaps no more extraordinary views
as to national defence ever came from any one
with a claim to be a statesman.</p>

<p>Jefferson&#8217;s election had only just been preceded
by one of the most extraordinary incidents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of our naval history: the impressment in
1800 of the frigate <i>George Washington</i> by the
Dey of Algiers to carry a shipload of tribute to
the Sultan of Turkey. This ship, commanded
by Captain William Bainbridge, one of the most
capable officers of our service, had been sent
with our own tribute to Algiers, where he arrived
September, 1800. The Dey had got into
disfavor by making peace with France while
Turkey was at war with that country on account
of the occupancy of Egypt by Bonaparte.
Hence the desire of the Dey for restoration to
favor. He threatened instant war against the
United States in case of Bainbridge&#8217;s refusal.
The <i>George Washington</i> lay under the guns of
the port and escape was extremely doubtful;
there was the strong probability of the seizure
of the ship, the slavery of the officers and crew,
and the consequent subjection of our large commerce
in the Mediterranean to destruction.
Bainbridge, gallant man as he was, esteemed it
his duty to sacrifice, possibly, his good name and
comply. Our consul advised his so doing and
he finally yielded, though in bitterness of spirit,
aggravated by the attitude of the Dey, who
said: &#8220;You pay me tribute by which you become
my slaves. I have therefore a right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
order you as I please.&#8221; The situation was but
the outcome of years of compliance with such a
system.</p>

<p>Bainbridge sailed on October 19, 1800, for
Constantinople with a mixed cargo: an ambassador
and suite of a hundred, a hundred negro
women and children, four horses, a hundred and
fifty sheep, twenty-five cattle, four lions, four
tigers, four antelopes, twelve parrots, and
funds and specie and presents amounting to
nearly a million dollars; all this in a small ship
with accommodations for a crew of 131. An
element of humor in the situation was the
necessity of laying the ship&#8217;s head to point
to Mecca at the frequent times of prayer,
one being stationed at the compass to insure
correctness of direction. The fact that the ship
was named <i>George Washington</i> added to the incongruity
of the situation. Death had saved
Washington himself from the pain of knowledge.
The cruise, however, had one benefit, in making
known our flag and country to the Turks. During
his stay in Constantinople, Bainbridge&#8217;s
personal qualities and the excellent order of his
ship made a deep impression and were of lasting
benefit to his country.</p>

<p>Throughout the year 1800 the attitude of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Dey of Tripoli had become steadily more
threatening, and by February, 1801, he was
demanding a new treaty with a payment of
$250,000 and an annual tribute of $20,000. On
May 10, 1801, he declared war, and about June
1st Captain Richard Dale (Paul Jones&#8217;s first
lieutenant in the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i>) sailed
from Hampton Roads with three frigates: the
<i>President</i>, <i>Philadelphia</i>, and <i>Essex</i>, and the
schooner <i>Enterprise</i>, to protect our commerce
by blockade of Tripoli and Tunis if necessary.
A humiliating element of the situation was the
carrying of $30,000 which it was hoped the Dey
of Tripoli would accept as a compensation for
the annuity of naval stores.</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s arrival off Tripoli caused much disturbance
in the mind of the Dey, but nothing
occurred until on August 1st, when the <i>Enterprise</i>
captured a Tripolitan vessel of 14 guns and
80 men, after an action of three hours, which
was returned to Tripoli an empty hulk, Dale&#8217;s
orders not allowing him to take prizes, but to
sink, burn, or destroy. This curious phase of
things arose from the extraordinary views of
President Jefferson as to his constitutional
powers. War, as he saw things, could not
exist except by declaration of Congress, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
active the enemy in seizing American
ships and making slaves of American citizens
and seamen. The situation was remedied by
Congress on February 6, 1802, which gave the
President full powers to act, and was practically
a declaration of war.</p>

<p>Dale had orders to sail for home in October if
things should become peaceful, and was to leave
the Mediterranean in any case by December
1st. For this there were two reasons: it was
deemed unsafe to cruise in the Mediterranean
in winter, and the crews were enlisted for but
one year. Meanwhile, however, and despite
the extraordinary views of the President, Dale
carried out his semi-peaceful, semi-warlike
orders, so far as to blockade Tripoli and capture
ingoing vessels. In one of these were twenty
Tripolitan soldiers and an officer, who were
exchanged for three American prisoners. Dale
completed his orders so far as to return in
December with two ships only, leaving the
<i>Philadelphia</i> and <i>Essex</i>; the first to watch Tripoli
from Syracuse as a base, the second to
observe two Tripolitan vessels blockaded at
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>A new squadron was now formed with crews
enlisted for two years. Commodore Morris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
was ordered to the command with his broad-pennant
in the <i>Chesapeake</i> of such later ill-fortune.
The other ships were the <i>Constellation</i>,
<i>New York</i>, <i>John Adams</i>, <i>Adams</i>, and <i>Enterprise</i>.
It is not often that a family finds itself so
honored as was the Adams family in this instance,
with two ships of the name in the same
squadron. Isaac Chauncey commanded the
<i>Chesapeake</i>, John Rodgers the <i>John Adams</i>,
Isaac Hull was first lieutenant of the <i>New York</i>,
and Oliver Hazard Perry was a midshipman in
the <i>Adams</i>. All of these were to rise to high
distinction.</p>

<p>The ships of the new squadron sailed as they
could be got ready, the <i>Chesapeake</i> on April 27,
1802, the <i>John Adams</i> not until September 19th.
There is no special need to follow the blockade
of Tripoli by Morris&#8217;s squadron: the many attacks
upon the galleys, generally so close in
shore as to make it difficult to absolutely destroy
them; the rough experiences and dangers on
such a coast from heavy weather. There were
conspicuous cases of gallantry and of conduct
which went far to form the character of the
service yet in its infancy. Lieutenant David
Porter particularly gave evidence of his coming
fame. Morris, relieved temporarily by Commodore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Rodgers, went home in October, 1803,
to meet undeserved charges of want of vigor in
his command, which ended in wrongful dismissal
from the service.</p>

<p>By the middle of 1803 a new squadron was
formed of the <i>Constitution</i>, <i>Philadelphia</i>, and
of five brigs and schooners, the <i>Argus</i>, <i>Siren</i>,
<i>Nautilus</i>, <i>Vixen</i>, and <i>Enterprise</i>. Edward Preble
was the commodore in command.</p>

<p>It is a habit with some to call Paul Jones or
John Barry the &#8220;father of the navy&#8221; as race
sentiment or particular inclination may rule,
but neither has a claim of the sort. Jones never
served in the newly established service or had
anything to do with its organization. The
ephemeral navy of the Revolution had entirely
passed away; the navy of 1794 was not a
reconstitution; it was a new birth, and with
this Barry&#8217;s connection was without special
distinction. Jones was a Scot by birth; Barry
was an Irishman. Both are in the first rank as
naval officers, but neither did anything to form
the new navy. This was the work of Edward
Preble, American by long descent, tradition, and
training. Born in Portland, Maine, August
15, 1761, he ran away when seventeen to go to
sea in a privateer; he was shortly made a midshipman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
in the <i>Protector</i>, the largest ship of
the Massachusetts state navy; was in several
actions, and when the <i>Protector</i> was captured
became a prisoner in the prison ship <i>Jersey</i>, at
New York. When released he was immediately
again at sea, this time in the state
privateer <i>Winthrop</i>, and was of the party which
cut out an armed British brig from under the
British fort in Penobscot Bay. When the
United States navy came to life again he was
commissioned one of the first five lieutenants.
In 1799 he was promoted to captain and in
command of the <i>Essex</i> convoyed fourteen valuable
merchantmen to China. His high temper
and strict discipline were, in the early part of
his Mediterranean service, to make him somewhat
unpopular, but his great qualities soon
brought an admiration and regard which have
come down as a cherished tradition of the service,
as warm to-day as a hundred years since.
It is to him should be given the credit of establishing
the character of the little navy which
fought the War of 1812, covering itself with
fame, and bringing a new respect to our country
which owes his memory every honor, and
continues to owe it in much greater measure
than ever paid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>The <i>Philadelphia</i> was one of the first of the
new squadron to arrive abroad. Her haste
brought good fortune. Hearing at Gibraltar
of Tripolitan vessels off Cape de Gatt, the
southeastern corner of Spain, Captain Bainbridge
at once left, and, on the night of August
26th, came in contact not with Tripolitans
but with a Moorish ship, the <i>Meshboha</i>, of
twenty-two guns with a crew of 120 men, and a
captured brig from Boston, the <i>Celia</i>. We were
not at war with Morocco, but the Moorish
captain said that he had made the capture
anticipating war. The <i>Philadelphia</i> secured
her prizes at Gibraltar and went to her station
off Tripoli.</p>

<p>When the <i>Constitution</i> reached Gibraltar,
Preble of course learned at once of the occurrence
mentioned, and with his flagship and
three other vessels, one of which was the <i>John
Adams</i>, flying the broad-pennant of Commodore
Rodgers, who, though the senior officer, cheerfully
gave his services to the new commander-in-chief,
went to Tangier and demanded satisfaction.
The result was the complete disavowal
by Morocco of the hostile action.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We now</span> come to the other and vastly more
honorable phase of our relations with the Barbary
powers and to a series of actions which
form one of the most dramatic chapters of
American naval history. The <i>Philadelphia</i> and
schooner <i>Vixen</i> were the only two vessels
blockading Tripoli. It was October, with much
rough weather. Carried by the gales well to
the eastward of Tripoli, the <i>Philadelphia</i> on
October 31st was returning, with the wind now
shifted into the east, to her station. Sighting
a vessel inshore, she gave chase and pursued
until the soundings decreased to a danger
point and the ship was hauled off shore. The
coast was practically uncharted. The depth
increased and then again suddenly decreased
and the ship drove on to a reef which was one
of several to the eastward of the port, and between
which, as in most coral formations, was
deep water. The chase, knowing well the
water, reached the harbor in safety. The firing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
had brought out nine gunboats and no time
was to be lost if the ship were to be saved. She
had driven up the smooth eastern slope of the
reef her entire length. Guns were thrown
overboard, a few only being reserved for defence,
anchors cut from the bows, the foremast
cut away, and every means taken to lighten the
ship without avail. The hostile gunboats took
positions from which they could safely fire;
night was at hand; the <i>Vixen</i> was unfortunately
absent in search of a Tripolitan cruiser, and the
situation became such that it was imperative to
surrender to save the lives of the ship&#8217;s company.
The magazine was &#8220;drowned,&#8221; holes
bored in the ship&#8217;s bottom, and all done which
it was thought would insure the loss of the
ship. The colors were then lowered. The
Tripolitan crews acted in their usual manner,
stripping the men of their clothing and seizing
everything valuable, snatching even from Bainbridge
his epaulets, gloves, watch, and money
when in the boat of his captors. It was ten at
night when the 307 prisoners were landed at
the town. The officers were very civilly received
in state by the Pacha, given supper, and
at one o&#8217;clock of the morning taken to the
former American consulate, a house good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
enough in itself but almost destitute of furniture
and other comforts. But for the kindness
then shown by Mr. Nicholas C. Nissen, the
Danish consul, then as ever an unswerving
friend of American prisoners, their condition
would have been greatly more trying. His
name should be held in grateful remembrance.
He did indeed receive the thanks of Congress
and had the lasting gratitude of the officers of
the <i>Philadelphia</i>, who, after their release, presented
him in grateful recognition of his kindness
with a handsome testimonial of silver.</p>

<p>The men were confined in a warehouse much
too small but were later transferred to a larger.
They were set to various kinds of work, even
to the building, as mentioned, of a fort which
came to be known as the American fort and
received much maltreatment, particularly after
the burning of the <i>Philadelphia</i> in the harbor,
which soon came to pass.</p>

<p>The ship had been floated largely through
the influence of a northerly gale which had
raised the water-level on the coast and had on
November 5th been brought into the harbor.
Her guns and anchors were weighed, the former
mounted, and work begun to put the ship in
order. It is seldom that the soul of man is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
more sorely tried than was that of her gallant
captain when he became conscious of this success
of the enemy.</p>

<p>It was not until November 27th that Preble
on his arrival at Malta received news confirming
rumors of the <i>Philadelphia&#8217;s</i> loss in
letters from Bainbridge. In one of December
5, 1803, Bainbridge had suggested the destruction
of the <i>Philadelphia</i>, an idea which
naturally had already occurred to Preble. On
December 17th the latter sailed for Tripoli,
taking with him the <i>Enterprise</i>, commanded
by Decatur, who captured on the way a ketch (or
topsail schooner) named the <i>Mastico</i>, with a
crew of seventy. It was this captured vessel,
renamed the <i>Intrepid</i>, which was finally used
in the coming adventure and has thus come
down through more than a century in the list
of famous ships.</p>

<p>There was no trouble in finding officers or
men for the duty, but the whole was finally
turned over to the commander of the <i>Enterprise</i>
to arrange, and her crew only was to be employed
except that five midshipmen of the
<i>Constitution</i> were detailed to assist. Sixty-two
men of the <i>Enterprise</i> were taken. The officers
were Decatur, commanding; Lieutenants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Lawrence, Bainbridge, and Thorn, and Midshipman
Macdonough, all of the <i>Enterprise</i>;
Midshipmen Izard, Morris, Laws, Davis, and
Rowe of the <i>Constitution</i>, and Salvador Catalano
as pilot. Nearly two months from the inception
had been spent in maturing the plans, and
on the evening of February 3d the <i>Intrepid</i>
and <i>Siren</i> sailed together from Syracuse and
were off Tripoli on the 7th. A gale of wind
drove them to sea, and it was not until the 16th
that they were again off Tripoli. At dark the
<i>Intrepid</i> was two miles from the entrance, and
here Midshipman T. O. Anderson, with a boat
and nine men from the <i>Siren</i> (which was disguised
as a merchantman), was taken on board.
This made a total of eighty-four in the <i>Intrepid</i>.
A careful division of duties had been made.
Decatur, two midshipmen, and fifteen men were
to hold the spar (or upper) deck; the others
were to look after the lower decks except a midshipman
and his boat&#8217;s crew who were to secure
the <i>Philadelphia&#8217;s</i> boats and prevent the escape
ashore of the Tripolitan crew. The watchword
was &#8220;Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captured ship had her main and mizzen
topmasts housed (partially lowered), the foremast
which had been cut away was not yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
replaced; the sails were unbent and her lower
yards lying across the bulwarks. Her forty
guns were all loaded. She was lying in front of
the castle well inshore.</p>

<p>The night was almost calm with a smooth
sea and a young moon, and the <i>Intrepid</i> crept
slowly in, apparently exciting no distrust. The
main part of her crew was kept concealed, only
some ten or twelve being visible. She was
steered straight for the <i>Philadelphia&#8217;s</i> bow.</p>

<p>When still some distance off, a hail from the
<i>Philadelphia</i> was answered by the pilot, who
stated the vessel to be from Malta, and that her
anchors having been lost in a gale, permission
was asked to make fast to the ship. A sudden
shift of wind brought the <i>Intrepid</i> under the
frigate&#8217;s broadside and she drifted slowly
astern, exposed to the <i>Philadelphia&#8217;s</i> port
broadside at a distance of about forty yards.
So completely were the Tripolitans deceived
that they lowered a boat and sent a line. Some
of the <i>Intrepid&#8217;s</i> men had meanwhile got into
her boat and taken one to the frigate&#8217;s fore
chains (supports to the shrouds). They then
took the line from the frigate&#8217;s boat which had
been run from the after part of the ship and
made it fast aboard the <i>Intrepid</i>. Both lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
were hauled upon by the men lying down concealed
on her deck. On getting near the
<i>Philadelphia</i> the <i>Intrepid&#8217;s</i> anchors were discovered.
On this, the Tripolitans prepared to
cut the fasts, passing the cry of &#8220;Americanos.&#8221;
A strong pull brought the <i>Intrepid</i> alongside,
&#8220;where she was secured quick as thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ship was immediately boarded. The
Tripolitans crowded over to the starboard side
and forward, offering practically no resistance,
and large numbers jumped overboard. There
was some struggle below, &#8220;but in less than ten
minutes Decatur was on the quarter deck in
undisturbed possession of his prize.&#8221;</p>

<p>The orders to destroy the ship and not attempt
to get her away, which in the circumstances
of not a sail bent or a yard aloft would
have been almost impossible, were imperative.
The arrangements for firing her were so complete
that the combustibles prepared were
alight in a few minutes, and in some twenty-five
minutes from boarding the Americans were
hastening out of the ship to escape the flames.
Their movements were none too quick to escape;
the fasts were cut and the <i>Intrepid</i> shoved clear
only just in time herself to escape burning.
The sixteen sweeps were manned, and, aided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
by a light breeze, the little vessel with her brave
crew intact swept out of the harbor under the
fire of the batteries and the thunder of the
<i>Philadelphia&#8217;s</i> own guns as they heated and
discharged themselves, one broadside toward
the town, the other toward the English fort.
The only shot striking the <i>Intrepid</i> was one
passing through her topgallantsail. She was
met outside the harbor by the <i>Siren&#8217;s</i> boats.
The <i>Siren&#8217;s</i> commander had seen the rocket-signal,
agreed upon, from the <i>Philadelphia</i>,
and in the calm had used his sweeps to close in
and protect the <i>Intrepid</i> should she be attacked.
Before the signal could be answered the flames
were running aloft in the <i>Philadelphia</i>. &#8220;Presently
a boat was seen coming alongside and a
man in a sailor&#8217;s jacket sprang over the gangway
of the brig. It was Decatur to announce his
victory!&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> On the 19th both vessels were again
at Syracuse. This brilliant exploit made Decatur
a captain at the age of twenty-five and
promoted most of those who accompanied him.
It remains as one of the most gallant and successful
adventures of the sea, remarkable particularly
for the coolness of its procedure and
calm courage of execution. It was worthy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
all the praise given it at the time and which has
continued undimmed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The loss of the <i>Philadelphia</i> and Decatur&#8217;s
exploit gave an impetus to naval affairs, which
struggled then, as ever since, under conditions
of want of knowledge in our legislators and a
poor system of administration. There was,
for example, not a drydock in the whole country.
&#8220;Facts,&#8221; as Fenimore Cooper expresses
it, &#8220;were still leading opinion, and the gallant
men who were slowly fighting themselves into
favor were merely performing an office that
would seem inseparable from the advancement
of every free people in civilization.&#8221;</p>

<p>Preble&#8217;s whole force before Tripoli in July,
1804, was the frigate <i>Constitution</i>, six small
vessels of from 12 to 16 guns each, six gunboats,
and two bomb-vessels; an excellent force for
blockading and for attacking the Tripolitan
gunboats, which hugged the shores, but not
for bombarding the batteries in which were
115 guns.</p>

<p>From now on many brilliant actions between
the smaller craft took place, in one of which was
a famous incident of the general attack of
August 4, 1804, when Decatur, having already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
boarded and taken one gunboat, boarded
another. The captain of the second was a
large and powerful Turk who seized the pike
with which Decatur attacked him and used it
against the latter, who parried with his sword
which broke at the hilt. The pike entered the
fleshy part of Decatur&#8217;s breast. Decatur succeeded
in tearing it out and grappled with the
Turk. Both fell, the Turk uppermost. He
felt for his poniard, but Decatur, grasping his
arm with one hand, was able to take a small
pistol from his waistcoat pocket and passing
his arm around the Turk fired it into his back.
The ball passed entirely through his foe and
lodged in Decatur&#8217;s clothes. While this was
going on, another raised a sabre to cleave
Decatur, but a young seaman, named Daniel
Fraisher,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> interposed his arm, which was nearly
severed at the wrist. Lieutenant Trippe of
Gunboat No. 6 had an equally desperate encounter.
His own and the enemy&#8217;s gunboat
separated with the shock, leaving only nine
Americans aboard the Tripolitan. Trippe was
attacked by a powerful young Turk, who inflicted
eight sabre wounds in the head and two
in the breast. Trippe was brought to his knees,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
but he was able to give his adversary a final
thrust with his short pike, which ended the
struggle. When the captain thus fell, the
others surrendered. The desperate nature of
the struggle undertaken by the six gunboats
in the action may be understood when it is
known that the two boats captured by Decatur
carried about eighty men; of these fifty-two were
known to be killed and wounded, many jumped
overboard, and only eight unwounded prisoners
were taken. Stephen Decatur&#8217;s brother James
had command of Gunboat No. 2. In boarding,
he was shot through the forehead and died that
evening.</p>

<p>The details of the many sanguinary actions
during Preble&#8217;s blockade cannot be given.
Three captured gunboats, numbered 7, 8, and 9,
were changed in rig and added to the fleet. On
August 7th No. 7 blew up in action and of her
crew of twenty-eight, ten, including Lieutenant
Caldwell, her commander, and Midshipman
Dorsey, were killed, and six wounded.</p>

<p>The arrival of the <i>John Adams</i> on August 8th
brought the unwelcome word to Preble of the
coming of a new and more powerful force under
Commodore Samuel Barron, his senior. This, as it
was arranged, was an unfortunate necessity, as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
new squadron could not be organized without
putting in command some of Preble&#8217;s seniors,
and it was deplored by the Secretary of the Navy
in a letter to Preble. It is not, however, readily
seen why the crews with Preble, the times of
which had expired, could not have been replaced
by new crews, and only the two captains junior
to him sent. It was an act which showed feeble
unaccustomedness to administration. Preble
wrote in his private journal: &#8220;How much my
feelings are lacerated by this supersedure at the
moment of victory cannot be described and can
be felt only by an officer placed in my mortifying
situation.&#8221; He kept up his attacks, however,
while awaiting his relief, and on the night
of August 24th, after being much delayed by
heavy weather, a night attack was made by
bombardment with little reply. This was renewed
on the 28th; one Tripolitan gunboat was
sunk, two ran ashore, and the rest retreated.
The town was subjected to a heavy bombardment
during which a 24-pound shot entered the
quarters of the captive Americans, covering
Bainbridge in the d&eacute;bris.</p>

<p>On September 3d came Preble&#8217;s fifth and last
attack by bombardment. The next evening
the <i>Intrepid</i> was sent in with the intent of blowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
her up in the midst of the Tripolitan fleet.
A compartment was built in which was placed
15,000 pounds of powder connected with a slow
match expected to take fifteen minutes in burning.
Over the powder was placed one hundred
13-inch and fifty 9-inch shells, with a quantity
of solid shot and pig-iron ballast. She was commanded
by Commander Richard Somers, who
volunteered for the work and took with him, as
the only other officer, Lieutenant Wadsworth
of the <i>Constitution</i>. Ten men were taken. At
the last moment, before parting company with
the three vessels which accompanied the <i>Intrepid</i>
to a point near the entrance and stood by to receive
the boats when they should return, Lieutenant
Joseph Israel of the <i>Constitution</i> went
aboard the <i>Intrepid</i> to carry a message from the
commodore and begged so to stay that Somers
allowed him to do so.</p>

<p>The night was dark and the <i>Intrepid</i> was soon
lost in the gloom, when at 9:47, as marked in
the log of the <i>Constitution</i>, there was a terrific
explosion, followed by cries of terror and beating
of drums in the town and then silence. The
boats which were to return never came. The
bodies of the three officers and ten men were
from time to time recovered by the Tripolitans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
but the explosion, which evidently occurred before
intended, has ever remained a mystery.</p>

<p>Among the six names which appear on the
monument now at the Naval Academy, erected
by their brother officers to those killed at Tripoli,
are those of the three then lost, the three
other names being Caldwell, James Decatur,
and Dorsey. The total loss in Preble&#8217;s squadron
in these eleven months at Tripoli was thirty-two
killed and twenty-two wounded.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Preble</span> left for home without having come to
terms with the Pacha of Tripoli. He was not
willing to rise above $500 for each of the captives,
and would offer nothing for peace or for
tribute. Had he remained, it is very possible
that he would have forced a peace without a
ransom. Peace, however, was to come under
his successor largely through one of the extraordinary
adventures of our history.</p>

<p>Yusuf Karamanli, the Pacha of Tripoli, was
the youngest of three brothers. In 1790 at the
age of twenty he murdered the eldest, and when
his father died in 1796, and the second brother,
Hamet, was absent, he proclaimed himself Pacha.
Hamet, rather a weakling, took refuge in
Tunis, leaving his family at Tripoli. He had
taken up arms against his brother, using Derne,
some 500 miles east of Tripoli, as a base, but he
was unsuccessful, and in 1804 fled to Egypt.
The government in Washington, influenced
largely by ex-Consul Eaton, had decided to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Hamet as an asset in the war against Yusuf, and
thus placed at the disposition of the commodore
a moderate amount of money and military supplies.
Eaton was appointed a navy agent under
Commodore Barron, with a recommendation
from the Secretary of the Navy to use him in
connection with an effort to establish Hamet at
Tripoli in place of his brother Yusuf. It was a
scheme in full accord with Eaton&#8217;s adventurous
spirit and worthy his real ability.</p>

<p>The <i>Argus</i>, Captain Hull, thus left Malta in
September, 1804, for Alexandria, nominally to
convoy thence any vessels desiring protection,
but really to carry Eaton to find Hamet and
convey him to whatever should be decided as
the most convenient point from which to act
against Tripoli. Hamet was up the Nile. Eaton
explained frankly his intentions to the Viceroy
and passports were obtained for himself and
Hamet out of Egypt. Hamet was finally reached,
but such obstacles to leaving by sea were raised
through the influence of the French consul that
it was decided to go by land, it being feared that
the few Arabs whom Hamet had raised might
otherwise disappear. The <i>Argus</i> sailed for Malta
with a letter from Eaton to the commodore requesting
&#8220;that the expedition be met at Bomba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
Bay sixty miles east of Derne, with two more
small vessels, a bomb-ketch, two field pieces, a
hundred muskets, a hundred marines, and ten
thousand dollars.&#8221; A convention was made with
Hamet, the United States promising to do all
that was proper and right to reinstate him, reimbursement
of expenses to come from tribute
paid by other nations. Eaton was to be recognized
as commander-in-chief of the land forces
operating against the usurping brother.</p>

<p>The army was a motley array of some four
hundred, though Eaton says many thousands
could have been had had there been money and
subsistence. There were besides Eaton nine
Americans: Lieutenant O&#8217;Bannon, Midshipman
Peck, and seven marines; an English volunteer;
forty Greeks; some Arab horsemen, etc., and a
caravan of 107 camels and a few asses. These
began on March 8th a march across 500 and
more miles to Derne. Bomba was reached after
immense difficulties on April 15th. Signal-fires
were built on a high hill which were sighted by
the <i>Argus</i>. She brought a cheering letter from
the commodore announcing aid. Two days later
the <i>Hornet</i> arrived with an abundance of provisions,
and on the 23d, after a rest of a week, the
march of sixty miles to Derne was resumed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
This was made in two days. Derne was attacked
on the 27th from land and from sea by
the <i>Hornet</i> and <i>Nautilus</i> (which had also arrived).
The town was occupied after a strong
resistance and some loss. A Tripolitan force
now appeared, and there were unsuccessful efforts
to dislodge Eaton&#8217;s forces. After May
18th the attacks ceased. Dispatches were sent
to the commodore, and only the <i>Argus</i> remained
at Derne. On May 19th there came dispatches
from the commodore announcing peace negotiations,
and on June 11th came the <i>Constellation</i>
announcing peace and with orders to evacuate
Derne. There was nothing for the Americans
to do but to embark, taking with them
Hamet and his suite, twenty-five foreign cannoniers
with their artillery, and the small party
of Greeks. It was a pitiful abandonment of
men who were our allies, brought about through
the influence of Consul-General Lear, who, as
previously mentioned, had been invested with
full authority to negotiate a peace.</p>

<p>Lear had spent the winter of 1804-1805 with
Commodore Barron at Malta, over whom he acquired,
in Barron&#8217;s weakened condition of mind
and health, a great influence. He was strongly
opposed to Eaton&#8217;s expedition, and was the main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
factor in causing it to collapse; the aim of the
expedition, which was the capture of Tripoli and
dethronement of the Pacha, was not in accord
with his views. On May 26th Lear arrived off
Tripoli from Malta in the <i>Essex</i>, which delivered
to Captain Rodgers of the <i>Constitution</i> a letter
from Barron announcing the necessity of the
relinquishment by the latter of the command.
Lear had already been informed by a letter
written by the Danish consul at Tripoli of the
probability of the Pacha&#8217;s willingness to treat,
and at once on his arrival began negotiations.
The preliminaries, after parleys of more than a
week, were signed on June 3d. Prisoners were to
be exchanged, the United States paying a balance
of $60,000. A year was allowed to settle
disputes before action; prisoners were no longer
to be enslaved, and were at the conclusion of
peace to be restored without ransom. No tribute
was to be paid in future. Hamet was to be
&#8220;persuaded&#8221; to withdraw from Derne, and his
family was to be restored to him. There was,
however, a secret article which allowed the Pacha
four years in which to make this restoration.
The unwisdom of placing the negotiations
wholly in the hands of Lear had resulted in an
unsatisfactory peace, and attacks ensued which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
must have caused him much bitterness; for
General Eaton, as he was now called, pursued
him violently in the press and before Congress
to the end, in 1811, of Eaton&#8217;s life. Lear was
strongly criticised in Congress itself, Senator
Timothy Pickering declaring his conduct inexcusable.
Madison&#8217;s instructions as Secretary of
State anticipated that peace would be made
&#8220;without any price or pecuniary compensation
whatever&#8221;; and so undoubtedly it would have
been had negotiations been put in the hands of
the commodore of the now powerful force before
Tripoli. Nor would Eaton&#8217;s wonderful action
have gone for nought, nor would Hamet, whom
we had made our ally, been thrown overboard
with so little consideration. Commodore Rodgers
allowed him two hundred dollars monthly
to support himself and some fifteen dependents
at Syracuse (the winter headquarters of the
fleet) until twenty-four hundred dollars was
voted him by Congress in 1806. His family,
through pressure of our consul, was restored to
him in October, 1807, and though his brother
gave him residence in Morocco and a pension,
and later the governorship of Derne, he had, two
years later, to flee with his family to Egypt,
where he died.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>Eaton was received on his return with honor.
Massachusetts granted him ten thousand acres
in Maine (then a part of Massachusetts) and
Congress met his disbursements. The expedition
to Derne had cost forty thousand dollars
but Eaton declined everything for himself but
his personal expenses. He died in 1811 at the
age of fifty-seven, ending, too early, a life of picturesque
adventure, patriotic effort, and undaunted
courage. He is worthy of memory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Commodore Rodgers now turned his attention
to Tunis, where threatening conditions had
arisen from the capture of two Tunis vessels
which had attempted to run the blockade of
Tripoli. He appeared on August 1st with nearly
his whole force. A fortnight later, on an appearance
of delay, Rodgers informed Lear officially
that the Dey &#8220;must do one of three things by
simple request or must do all three by force. He
must give [a guarantee for the maintenance of
peace to be witnessed by the English and French
consuls], or he must give sufficient security for
peace and send a minister to the United States,
or he must make such alterations in the [existing]
treaty as you may require and as may satisfy
you that there is confidence to be placed in what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
he does. I have only to repeat that if he does
not do all that is necessary and proper, at the
risk of my conduct being disapproved by my
country, he shall feel the vengeance of the
squadron now in this bay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rodgers now in a letter to the Secretary of
the Navy of August 21, 1805, laid down the
honorable dictum which has ever been a rule of
conduct with the navy that: &#8220;Peace on honorable
terms is always preferable to war.&#8221; If
chastisement were to be inflicted he begged the
honor of being the instrument, pledging that if
he should be instructed by March, 1806, that
he would obtain an honorable peace before September,
making the Dey to pay all the expenses
of the war, and that, too, without any increase of
force. The Dey had, however, already accepted
the proposal of sending a minister to the
United States, and had agreed to keep the
peace until the result of the mission should be
known.</p>

<p>Our Barbary difficulties were, with occasional
troubles of a moderate nature, ended for nearly
ten years. We continued, under the treaty with
Algiers, to send an annual tribute of marine
stores to the value of twenty-one thousand dollars.
This, however, was but a remnant of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
early weakness and an honorable carrying out
of a treaty. The spectacle of the treatment of
our commerce by France and England roused
the envy of the Dey of Algiers, and finally the
War of 1812 overcame any good resolutions the
then Dey had, and spoliation began anew. Thus,
immediately after the peace, a powerful fleet
was sent into the Mediterranean under Decatur,
followed by another under Bainbridge, whose
flagship, the <i>Independence</i>, 74, was the first
American ship-of-the-line in foreign waters.
Farragut, who had already seen three years of
most stirring service and was then but fourteen,
was a midshipman aboard. But before Bainbridge
had arrived Decatur had appeared before
Algiers and &#8220;at the mouths of our cannon,&#8221; as
Decatur expressed in his dispatch to the Navy
Department, dictated a peace which abolished
tribute in any form forever, released all Americans,
and forced compensation for, and restoration
of, all American property seized or in the
Dey&#8217;s hands. This was within six weeks of the
sailing of the fleet from home. Decatur then
visited Tunis and Tripoli, and forced the instant
payment at each place of indemnities for British
prizes which, taken into port by an American
privateer, had been seized later by the British.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
Of course the British consul protested, but without
avail. He also caused the release of two
Danes in remembrance of the unceasing kindness
to Americans, through many years, of the
Danish consul, Nissen, and of a Sicilian family
of eight, in consideration of aid given to Preble
by the king of the two Sicilies. It was a fine
instance of gratitude acknowledged.</p>

<p>Thus, practically, ended our troubles with
Barbary. &#8220;It was not to be endured,&#8221; said the
English naval historian, Brenton, &#8220;that England
should tolerate what America had resented and
punished,&#8221; and thus after one abortive threat,
when he paid heavy ransom for 1,200 Neapolitans
and Sicilians, during the negotiations for
which he was grossly insulted, and the British
consul and his family treated &#8220;in a manner the
most scandalous and insulting,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Lord Exmouth
was sent in August, 1816, with a powerful
fleet, which, combined with a Dutch force, bombarded
Algiers to subjection, and Christian
slavery was at an end. The Dey shortly before
this having shown signs of regretting having
made the American treaty, another powerful
American fleet appeared shortly after Lord Exmouth&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
bombardment, which removed the intention
of renewal of hostile acts.</p>

<p>Thus ended, practically, the extraordinary
career of piracy and slavery which through so
many generations had been submitted to by
Europe. It was not, however, until 1824, when
the demand for continuance of tribute from
Holland was successfully resisted, that Algiers
finally dismissed the idea of return to her ancient
ways.</p>

<p>It should be a proud memory to Americans
that it was the American navy which first resisted
and brought to terms the barbarous corsairs,
so long the scourge of commerce and enslavers
of white men. The Frenchman Dupuy,
at the end of his admirable history of our Barbary
wars, pays us a fine tribute, saying: &#8220;The
statesmen [of America], breaking loose from the
unworthy yielding of Europe to the Barbary
States, had in hardly thirty years broken the
abominable traditions which the Christian
powers had shamefully respected for ages.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> we were fighting the Algerines, we were
suffering from depredations on our commerce by
France and England a hundredfold more serious
than all we had undergone from the African corsairs.
The story is as shameful to the statesmanship
of the period as our stand with regard
to Barbary was honorable.</p>

<p>Napoleon dominated Europe by land; England
by sea. The former&#8217;s great aim after subjecting
the Continental states, rotten with the
decaying feudalism of the past centuries, was to
destroy English supremacy by closing all Europe
to English commerce, an effort which was
to fail through one of the greatest instincts of
man, that of trade. Almost universal war thus
made neutral America the great carrier; our
shipping increased by amazing bounds and covered
every sea. But between the two great
antagonists it was to be heavily ground. Our
losses were in many millions, our ships for a considerable
period being seized at an average of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
three a day. It would take a book much larger
than this to go into the details of this question
which looms so large even to this day. Added
to the question of ships was that of impressment
of our seamen who were taken out of our merchantmen,
and in two cases from men-of-war,
to man those of the British navy, on the claim
that a British subject was always a subject. In
carrying out this dictum, a vast number of
Americans were claimed as such from mere appearance
or other characteristic or for no reason
whatever except that he was a likely man. Over
11,000 were to be so taken before, in 1812, we
went to war.</p>

<p>Jefferson was President for the eight years
beginning March 4, 1801. His residence as minister
in France from 1785 to 1788 had given
him as mentioned leanings which affected all
his later views, despite the monstrous excesses
of the French Revolution. He had very peculiar
ideas of the ocean-carrying trade, mentioning it
as: &#8220;this protuberant navigation which has kept
us in hot water from the commencement of the
government.&#8221; He would &#8220;an&#8217; he could,&#8221; have
made of America a rural community, apparently
not being able to comprehend that man is, by
nature, a trader; that trade is the real civilizer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
and missioner beyond all other endeavors combined.
Linked with this was a willingness to
submit the country to unparalleled insult and
injury in the seizure of ships and impressment
of our seamen without taking any efficient or
reasonable steps to resist such outrages. The
extent of our Government&#8217;s submission is well
shown by Captain Basil Hall in his most interesting
reminiscences as a seaman. Describing
his life as a midshipman in the <i>Leander</i>, in the
middle years of Jefferson&#8217;s administration, he
says: &#8220;Every morning at daybreak during our
stay off New York we set about arresting the
progress of all vessels we saw, firing off guns to
the right and left, to make every ship that was
running in heave to, or wait until we had leisure
to send a boat on board &#8216;to see,&#8217; in our lingo,
&#8216;what she was made of.&#8217; I have frequently
known a dozen, and sometimes a couple of dozen
ships, lying to, a league or two off the port,
losing their fair wind, their tide and, worse
than all, their market, for many hours, sometimes
the whole day, before our search was completed.&#8221;</p>

<p>A crowning outrage came in 1807 when the
frigate <i>Chesapeake</i> flying the broad-pennant of
Commodore Samuel Barron was leaving for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Mediterranean. She had been preparing for
some time for sea, but finally was hurried off in
a state wholly unfit to go suddenly into action
with any vessel of moderate force, and certainly
not with the much more powerful ship which
was about to attack her. This ship, the <i>Leopard</i>,
of 54 guns, had been lying, along with several
other British men-of-war, in Lynnhaven Bay,
just within the Capes of the Chesapeake. They
were watching for two French frigates then lying
off Annapolis. This occupancy, for such a purpose,
of our waters, was in itself an insulting
abuse of our neutrality, though Jefferson could
speak of it as &#8220;enjoying our hospitality.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Chesapeake</i> passed out of the capes about
noon on June 22, 1807. When about ten miles
outside the <i>Leopard</i> hailed saying she had a dispatch
for Commodore Barron. This &#8220;dispatch&#8221;
proved to be a copy of an order from the British
admiral, Berkeley, to search the <i>Chesapeake</i> for
deserters from certain British ships, the order to
be first shown to her captain. On Barron&#8217;s refusal
to submit to such outrage the <i>Chesapeake</i>
was fired into by the <i>Leopard</i>, without, in the
unprepared state of the ship, being able to return
a gun. Twenty-one men were killed and
wounded, the ship searched and four of the crew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
claimed as British deserters, were taken away.
&#8220;Of these, one was hanged, one died, and the
other two, after prolonged disputation, were returned
five years later to the deck of the <i>Chesapeake</i>
in formal reparation.&#8221; A deeper insult to
a nation could scarcely have been offered. All
the same, it ended only on the part of the administration
in what may be called a fit of sulks
known as the embargo, which from December,
1807, to March, 1809, took American commerce
by the throat and forbade our merchant ships
to go to sea. It was much as if a man should reduce
himself to bread and water as a revenge
against an enemy.</p>

<p>Jefferson, meanwhile, with the British practically
blockading our ports and taking men from
vessels entering New York and other harbors,
was seized with a passion for gunboats, and
shortly after the <i>Chesapeake</i> incident, which
cried aloud for ships-of-the-line instead of the
two hundred petty toys he devised and caused
to be built, and which could not go to sea without
striking their one gun into the hold, we find him
saying: &#8220;Believing, myself, that gunboats are
the only water defence which can be useful to us,
and protect us from the ruinous folly of a navy,
I am pleased with everything which promises to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
improve them.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It was a mind far better
fitted to deal with the manipulations of a political
party than with the care of a nation which
he was not so very far from wrecking by an insensate
policy of peace at any price. Peace,
however, cannot be kept by one only of the interested
parties declaring such a preference.
One must be in a position to command peace,
and this failure was Jefferson&#8217;s great mistake, a
mistake which from every point of view was to
cost us dear. &#8220;Whether with or without a war,
a navy would have saved us the six years of humiliation
which were to intervene between 1806
and 1812; it would have saved the embargo
which was to tie to the wharves in rotting idleness
more than a million tons of shipping which
had been engaged in foreign trade; to bring
grass-grown streets to our greatest ports, and
strain the sentiment of the several sections of
the Union to the point of separation. It would
have saved the War of 1812, the capture and
burning of Washington, and the shameful ineptitude,
with one brilliant exception, of our army
commanders in that contest.... There
would have been a cessation of British impressment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and there would have been no such orders
in council as those directed to the destruction of
American commerce; or had these come before
America was ready with her navy there would
have been quick renunciation.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Gallatin, Jefferson&#8217;s Secretary of the Treasury,
pressed to apply the surplus of two millions a
year (&#8220;and,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is a very low calculation&#8221;),
which he considered would be lost in case
of war, wholly &#8220;to the building of ships of the
line.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Said Gouverneur Morris in the Senate
(and it was the expression of one of the ablest
minds of the country): &#8220;When we have twenty
ships-of-the-line at sea, and there is no good
reason why we should not have them, we shall be
respected by all Europe.... The expense
compared with the benefit is moderate, nay, trifling.
Whatever sums are necessary to secure
the national independence must be paid....
If we will not pay to be defended, we must pay
for being conquered.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Instead of a fleet which would have commanded
respect, the United States had built in
the years 1801-1811 &#8220;two sloops of 18 guns and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
two brigs of 16, and out of twelve frigates had
permitted three to rot at their moorings&#8221;; and
this while 917 American ships had been seized
by the British, many more than this number by
the French, and our men taken from our vessels
by the thousand and impressed into the British
service. There is an official record of 6,257 of
these, but it is known that the number ran to
over 11,000. Such things, if we were to survive
as a nation, could only bring war, whether Jefferson
and Madison wished war or not. The instigators
of such conditions had not long to wait
to repent their folly.</p>

<p>The affair of the <i>Chesapeake</i> had stirred the
soul of the little navy, at least, to its depth.
There were now, in 1810, in commission, the
<i>President</i>, 44; <i>Constitution</i>, 44; <i>United States</i>, 44;
<i>Essex</i>, 32; <i>John Adams</i>, 24; <i>Wasp</i>, 18; <i>Hornet</i>,
18; <i>Argus</i>, 16; <i>Siren</i>, 16; <i>Nautilus</i>, 12; <i>Enterprise</i>,
12, <i>Vixen</i>, 12. The whole list is given, as nearly
all these were to make names for themselves.
Attention, too, began to be turned to the lakes,
for war was now foreseen by all naval officers
and at least some of the administration. The
British had a considerable force upon the American
coast, but they were now more chary of giving
offence. The danger was emphasized on May<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
16, 1811, when the <i>President</i>, carrying Commodore
Rodgers&#8217;s broad-pennant, and at sea on account
of having heard of the impressment of a
seaman near Sandy Hook, sighted a strange
man-of-war which stood away. The <i>President</i>
gave chase but did not come near until about
8:30 in the evening when, on a hail from the
<i>President</i>, the stranger fired a gun which struck
the <i>President&#8217;s</i> mainmast. The latter at once
fired a broadside, and recognizing shortly that
her antagonist was disabled ceased fire. The
other began anew but was soon silenced. At
daylight the <i>President</i> sent a boat and found that
the ship was the British sloop-of-war, <i>Little Belt</i>,
of 18 guns. She had suffered severely and thirty-one
of her people had been killed and wounded.
Offers of aid were given but declined, and the
British cruiser stood for Halifax.</p>

<p>Naturally the strong tension already existing
was increased and matters moved rapidly. On
June 18, 1812, the United States declared war.</p>

<p>At the moment of America&#8217;s declaration of war
against England Napoleon was on his way to
Russia with an army destined never to return.
Spain was being desolated by the struggle of the
French and British in the peninsula; all the
Spanish provinces in South America were in revolution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
With the entry of the United States
the whole western world was at war.</p>

<p>Our population at this time, excluding negroes,
was about 7,500,000; that of Great Britain was
about 15,000,000. We had a navy of three large
and one small frigate, one sloop-of-war, and seven
smaller vessels, with 500 officers, of whom twelve
were captains. There were 5,230 men in the enlisted
force, of whom 2,436 were destined for the
cruising ships, &#8220;the remainder being for service
at the forts and navy yards, in the gunboats, and
on the lakes.&#8221; In the British navy were over a
thousand ships.</p>

<p>There can of course be no comparison between
such forces; nor could there in the long run be
any doubt as to the result, but the American
navy was to achieve, in the unequal struggle, a
series of victories which brought results psychically
the equal of victories of great fleets. It is
not that we were continuously victorious, but
in the main our success was so great and of a
character to which the British navy and public
were so unaccustomed that our victories were a
staggering blow to Britain&#8217;s self-sufficiency. It
must be remembered that the French navy of
Louis XVI&#8217;s time had been, so far as officers and
morale were concerned, swept out of existence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
by the French Revolution. The French fleet of
the Consular and Napoleonic period was now not
only ill-officered, but through the constant blockades
of the British had but little of the sea habit
by which only a navy can be efficient. The
Spanish navy had no real organization or other
qualities of success under circumstances of even
much worse neglect. The British ships, well officered,
well manned, and with constant sea practice,
had no real antagonists, for it is absurd to
compare in efficiency such organizations as that
which fought under Nelson at Trafalgar and
those under Villeneuve and Gravina in the same
battle. The American navy was to show a different
standard.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were three important and epoch-making
events in the war: the victory of the <i>Constitution</i>
over the <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>, the battle of Lake Erie, and
the battle of Lake Champlain. Each of these
was of such immense importance that they overshadow
all others, picturesque and striking as
others were.</p>

<p>The administration had at first only considered
the laying up of our ships, but the indignant
protests of our naval officers caused
another course. The first ships to get to sea
were those at New York: the <i>President</i>, 44, Commodore
Rodgers; the <i>Essex</i>, 32, Captain David
Porter; and the <i>Hornet</i>, 18, Master Commandant
Lawrence. These were joined down the bay on
June 21st by the <i>United States</i>, 44, Commodore
Decatur; and the <i>Congress</i>, 36, Lieutenant Commandant
Sinclair from Norfolk. All except the
<i>Essex</i>, which was overhauling her rigging, got to
sea on the 21st, immediately after the reception
of the declaration of war, and stood southeast to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
intercept a reported fleet of West Indiamen. On
June 23d, however, a frigate, later known to be
the <i>Belvidera</i>, was sighted and chased. On
nearing her, Rodgers himself went forward to
direct the firing, and at 4:30 he fired the
starboard forecastle gun, the first shot of the
war. The next gun was fired from the main
deck by the officer of the division, and a third
was fired by Rodgers. The three shots had all
struck the chase, killing and wounding seven
men. A fourth was now fired from the main
deck. This gun burst, lifting the forecastle
deck, killing and wounding sixteen men. Among
the latter was Rodgers, who was thrown into the
air and in falling broke his leg. The forward
guns being thrown out of action, the <i>President</i>
was obliged to yaw from time to time to bring
her broadside guns to bear. This gave the chase
an advantage which was added to by her throwing
overboard boats and anchors and fourteen
tons of water. By midnight she was out of danger.
The <i>President</i> does not seem to have been
handled as well as she might have been, but account
must be taken of the very serious accident
aboard and of the injury to the commodore.
The <i>Belvidera&#8217;s</i> fire killed and wounded six of
the <i>President&#8217;s</i> crew. She was well handled and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
her captain, Richard Byron, deserves marked
credit for his escape. Rodgers continued his
cruise in pursuit of the West Indiaman as far as
the entrance to the English Channel, but by
August 31st was in Boston, having made but
seven prizes and one recapture.</p>

<p>The <i>Essex</i> did not leave New York until June
23d. The ship carried, mostly, only carronades
which were totally inefficient except at close
quarters. This fact placed her at a great disadvantage
when in meeting a convoy of troops
she was unable to bring to action the convoying
frigate. She cut out, however, one ship with
197 soldiers aboard. But on August 13th she
captured the sloop-of-war, <i>Alert</i>, of twenty 18-pounder
carronades, the first man-of-war prize
of the war. The <i>Essex</i> returned to New York
on September 7th, having taken ten prizes and
423 prisoners.</p>

<p>The <i>Constitution</i>, Captain Hull, had returned,
just before the outbreak of the war, from Europe
where she had been sent to pay the interest on
our Dutch loan. She shipped a new crew, and
on July 12th sailed from Annapolis. On the
17th when off the Virginia coast, and barely out
of sight of land, six vessels were discovered, one
of which, as it turned out, and much the nearest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
being the <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>. The next morning, the
weather almost calm, there were four frigates, a
ship-of-the-line, and a brig and a schooner just
out of gunshot; the two last were prizes. There
then ensued a chase famous in American naval
annals for the admirable way in which the <i>Constitution</i>
was handled, and for her success. She
hoisted out her boats in the calm and towed;
the enemy put the boats of two ships to tow the
headmost. Their advantage was overcome by
Hull&#8217;s using all the cordage of the ship available
for such a purpose in running a kedge ahead
nearly half a mile and hauling in upon the hawser.
The kedges thus employed caused the
<i>Constitution</i> to gain largely until the enemy discovered
the method and himself applied it. For
two days this most exciting and exhausting chase
continued. On the evening of the 20th there was
a heavy squall, which was utilized by Hull with
the utmost judgment and during which a large
gain in distance was made. On its clearing away
all apprehension ended; all but two of the frigates
were far distant and most of the fleet hull
down. At 8:15 next morning the English gave
up the chase, thus ending as exciting three
days and nights as any of the war. The
admirable manner in which the <i>Constitution</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
was handled has ever been the admiration
of seamen.</p>

<p>The <i>Constitution</i> went into Boston, but Hull,
fearing orders for detachment, which in fact were
on the way from Washington, hurried to sea
again on August 2d. On the 19th, at a point
some 400 miles southeast of Halifax, he met the
British frigate, <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>, Captain Dacres. The
latter on the <i>Constitution&#8217;s</i> near approach lay-to
with her maintopsail to the mast, showing her
willingness to engage. The battle began a little
after 6:00 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and before seven the <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>
was dismasted and in a sinking condition. Her
crew was taken off; she was set afire, and in a
quarter of an hour blew up. The <i>Constitution</i>
was practically uninjured and in a few hours
could have gone into action again. She was, it
is true, the heavier ship, with thirty 24-pounders
against the <i>Guerri&egrave;re&#8217;s</i> thirty 18&#8217;s, and twenty-four
32-pounder carronades against the <i>Guerri&egrave;re&#8217;s</i>
sixteen; and a total of 55 guns and 468 men
against the <i>Guerri&egrave;re&#8217;s</i> 49 guns and 272 men,
but the injury was entirely disproportionate.
The <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i> had seventy-nine men killed and
wounded. The <i>Constitution</i> had seven killed
and seven wounded. The <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i> lost every
mast and her hull was so riddled that she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
not be carried into port. So little was the <i>Constitution</i>
injured that in the same evening all
damage was repaired and another ship, supposedly
an enemy, which appeared at 2:00 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
sheered off.</p>

<p>The ships were not markedly different in size,
the <i>Constitution</i> being 1,576 tons American measurement,
the <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i> 1,338 British. But by
the latter the <i>Constitution</i> would have been but
1,426. The difference in size and force, however,
was a small matter considering the fact that before
the outbreak of the war it was confidently
affirmed that British sloops-of-war would lie
alongside American frigates with impunity.</p>

<p>The capture of the <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i> by the <i>Constitution</i>
is a great landmark in our history&mdash;a second
&#8220;shot heard round the world.&#8221; It was not simply
the taking of a British frigate; it was a second
declaration of American independence. We had
so long been called spaniels and curs in the British
press; we had so long submitted basely (the
word is none too strong to describe our administration
of the Jeffersonian period); there had
become so strongly entrenched in the British
and French mind that we would submit to any
insult so long as our ships might sail, even at the
cost of the immense toll they took of them, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
our going to war was considered impossible.
New England, the chief sufferer, was in a dangerous
spirit which threatened secession. All this
changed instantly when the news spread from
town to town, from farm to farm. The Americans
became another people. It revived the dormant
spirit of nationality and gave a deathblow
to the disunionist spirit of the period. How
it permeated the soul of the country was shown
in a remarkable way at the death of a lady
of the Adams family in 1903. Born in 1808,
she was but four years old at the time of
the battle, but so vividly had the exultation
of her elders been impressed upon the child&#8217;s
mind, that on the day of her death, more
than ninety years after, her mind reverted to
but one thought, the most deeply impressed
of her childhood. In tremulous tones, though
otherwise apparently unconscious, she kept repeating
through this last day of her life the expression
of her elders in 1812: &#8220;Thank God for
Hull&#8217;s victory.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Nothing could show more
strongly the immensity of exultation and relief.
The <i>Constitution</i> was to have other victories,
was to come unscathed through the war, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
was for many years to carry our flag in honor in
many seas; but this victory alone should enshrine
the ship in the hearts of all true Americans
as an instrument which went far to preserve
this Union and its government. Fortunately,
through Oliver Wendell Holmes&#8217;s noble poem, she
still remains, honored in her old age, a glorious
memory of victory in a noble cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On October 18th the sloop-of-war <i>Wasp</i>, of 18
guns and 135 men, commanded by Captain
Jacob Jones, captured the British brig <i>Frolic</i>, of
19 guns and 110 men. The first lieutenant, Biddle,
who had gallantly led the boarders, hauled
down the <i>Frolic&#8217;s</i> flag at 12:15, forty-three
minutes after the beginning of the action. Almost
at once afterward both of the <i>Frolic&#8217;s</i> masts
went by the board. Not twenty of her men had
escaped unhurt. Every officer was wounded,
and the first lieutenant and master died soon
after. Her total loss was thus ninety killed and
wounded. Says the distinguished French Admiral
Jurien de la Gravi&egrave;re, commenting on this
action: &#8220;On occasions when the roughness of
the sea would seem to render all aim excessively
uncertain the effects of [the American] artillery
were not less murderous than under more advantageous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
conditions.&#8221; Unfortunately, a little
later, the British <i>Poictiers</i>, 74, came in sight, and
the <i>Wasp</i> not only had to yield her capture but
was herself carried a prize into Bermuda, where
Jones and his men were later exchanged. Captain
Jones was promoted to the command of the
<i>Macedonian</i>, which had been captured by the
<i>United States</i> only a week after the <i>Wasp&#8217;s</i> own
brilliant action.</p>

<p>The <i>United States</i> and <i>Argus</i>, under Commodore
Decatur, had left Boston on October 8th
in company with Commodore Rodgers, commanding
the <i>President</i> and the <i>Congress</i>. The
latter was successful in making one valuable
prize and eight others of but small value, and re&euml;ntered
Boston on December 31st. Decatur
had separated from Rodgers&#8217;s command on October
12th, and on the 18th, about 500 miles
south by west of the Azores, he met the frigate
<i>Macedonian</i>, of 49 guns and 301 men, commanded
by Captain Richard Carden. There
was about the same difference in force as between
the <i>Constitution</i> and <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i> and about the
same in destruction. The <i>Macedonian</i> had forty-three
killed and mortally wounded, and sixty-one
wounded; the <i>United States</i> had a lieutenant
and six seamen killed or mortally wounded, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
five wounded. The action lasted an hour and a
half. The <i>Macedonian</i> had received over a hundred
shot in the hull, her mizzenmast had gone
by the board, and her fore and maintopmasts
at the cap. Her rigging was badly cut and many
of her guns had been dismounted. On the other
hand, the <i>United States</i> had suffered no injuries
which could not at once be repaired. It was
clear that the American gunnery was immensely
superior, though the <i>Macedonian</i> had been regarded
a crack ship. The British ship had on
board eight impressed Americans. These, though
objecting to fighting their countrymen, were
obliged to stay at the guns, and three were killed.</p>

<p>Fortunately the damages to the <i>Macedonian</i>
were not so severe that she had to be destroyed;
convoyed by the <i>United States</i>, she was carried
into New London, reaching there on December
4th.</p>

<p>On October 26, 1812, Commodore Bainbridge
sailed from Boston with the <i>Constitution</i>, which
he personally commanded, and the <i>Hornet</i>, 18,
Captain Lawrence. The <i>Essex</i>, under Captain
David Porter, was also to be part of Bainbridge&#8217;s
squadron, but she was in the Delaware
and did not get to sea until two days after Bainbridge
left Boston. In anticipation of a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
cruise, the ship carried an unusual number of
both officers and men. Very unfortunately, she
had to retain, against Porter&#8217;s protest, a battery
of short-range carronades with but six long
12-pounders. She was given the island of Fernando
de Noronha, off Brazil, as a rendezvous.
She was not to meet her consorts, but to have
adventures of her own of a very remarkable
character.</p>

<p>Bainbridge, touching at Fernando de Noronha,
went into Bahia, Brazil, and found there a British
sloop-of-war of the same force as the <i>Hornet</i>.
Lawrence challenged her captain to a fight,
pledging that the <i>Constitution</i> would not interfere.
The challenge, however, was not accepted,
among the reasons being that the <i>Bonne Citoyenne</i>
had on board &pound;500,000 in species. Bainbridge,
leaving the <i>Hornet</i> to watch the British
ship, went to sea. December 29th, being still
near Bahia, he sighted two ships: one turned out
to be the frigate <i>Java</i>; the other a captured ship,
the <i>William</i>, in company. The latter was directed
to go into Bahia and the <i>Java</i> stood toward
the <i>Constitution</i>. The latter stood off to
get clear of the land, in plain view, and thus get
out of neutral waters. There was a mutual readiness
to engage. The <i>Java</i> came down with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
light free wind, furling her mainsail and royals.
The <i>Constitution</i>, with royal yards aloft, and
which she carried throughout the battle, was under
about the same canvas. The firing began at
2:00 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, with a shot at long range from the
<i>Constitution</i>, but the two ships quickly neared
to pistol range. They approached so near that
they were less than 600 feet apart. The <i>Java</i> was
being so much cut up aloft that an attempt was
made to board, but during this the <i>Constitution</i>
poured in a most destructive raking fire (i. e.,
lengthwise of the enemy), bringing down the
<i>Java&#8217;s</i> maintopmast and cutting away the foremast
just under the foretop. The attempt to
board failed, the ships fell apart and began anew
as furiously as ever. Captain Lambert of the
<i>Java</i> was killed and the ship continued to be
fought gallantly by her first lieutenant, Chads,
who was already wounded. But the British,
with the wreck of the maintopmast with its
hamper over the side, the foretopmast gone, and
a little later the mizzenmast and what remained
of the foremast, could do no more; the <i>Java&#8217;s</i>
guns were completely silenced. At 4:05, the
<i>Java&#8217;s</i> flag being shot away, Bainbridge thought
she had struck. He then hauled by the wind
and crossed the <i>Java&#8217;s</i> bows. The latter&#8217;s mainmast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
fell, leaving her a complete wreck. The
<i>Constitution</i> went to windward, spent an hour in
repairing the very moderate damages to her rigging,
and then again stood down for her enemy,
whose flag had again been shown. This, of
course, meant nothing in such circumstances,
and as soon as the <i>Constitution</i> stood across her
bows it was struck.</p>

<p>The <i>Constitution</i>, after her repairs of an hour,
was now again, in naval language, all ataunto.
Her loss had been eight seamen and one marine
killed; the fifth lieutenant, John C. Aylwin, and
two seamen mortally wounded; Commodore
Bainbridge and twelve seamen severely wounded;
seven seamen and two marines slightly wounded;
a total killed and wounded of thirty-four.</p>

<p>The <i>Java</i> had been cut to pieces; &#8220;she was a
riddled and entirely dismasted hulk.&#8221; She lost
her captain and five midshipmen killed or mortally
wounded, and six officers and four midshipmen
wounded. Her total loss was forty-eight
killed and one hundred and two wounded.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The two ships were not very unequal in force,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
the <i>Constitution</i> being about 10 per cent. stronger
in weight of gunfire and with about 10 per cent.
more men. The larger number of men aboard
the <i>Java</i> than she usually carried was due to her
having on board men for some other ships. Both
ships were handled with remarkable skill and
coolness, but the American gunnery had shown
itself enormously superior. It had so wrecked
the <i>Java</i> that Bainbridge, now 5,000 miles from
home and on an unfriendly coast, gave up the
idea of attempting to save the ship. He lay by
for several days removing the wounded and
saving the effects of the crew. The <i>Java</i> was
then blown up, and the <i>Constitution</i> went into
Bahia and paroled the <i>Java&#8217;s</i> officers and crew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our gallant enemy,&#8221; reported Lieutenant
Chads, &#8220;has treated us most generously,&#8221; and
Lieutenant-General Hislop who with his staff
were passengers in the <i>Java</i> for the East, presented
Commodore Bainbridge with a very handsome
sword as a token of gratitude for the kindness
with which he had treated the prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Bainbridge, his ship needing repairs after a
long period of service which had begun before
the war, sailed from Bahia on January 6, 1813,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
and reached Boston February 27th, having been
absent 119 days. The <i>Hornet</i> had been left at
Bahia observing the <i>Bonne Citoyenne</i>, but the
arrival of the <i>Montagu</i>, 74, relieved the captain
of the British sloop-of-war from risking his ship
and treasure. The <i>Hornet</i>, on the <i>Montagu&#8217;s</i> arrival,
put to sea late in the evening unmolested.</p>

<p>The war had now lasted six months, and instead
of the little American navy being swept
from the sea, it had been a David to smite a
Goliath. The capture of three British frigates
in the three successive combats stirred Britain
to the quick. Said the <i>Pilot</i> of London: &#8220;Five
hundred merchantmen [taken] and three frigates!
Can this be true? Will the English people
read this unmoved? Any man who foretold
such disasters this day last year would have been
treated as a madman or a traitor. He would
have been told that ere seven months had gone
the American flag would have been swept from
the ocean, the American navy destroyed, and
the maritime arsenals of the United States reduced
to ashes. Yet not one of the American
frigates has struck. They leave their ports when
they choose, and return when it suits their convenience.
They cross the Atlantic, they visit
the West Indies, they come to the chops of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
Channel, they parade along the coast of South
America. Nothing chases them; nothing intercepts
them&mdash;nay, nothing engages them but to
yield in triumph.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> British force on our own coast was now, in
1813, much increased. Particular attention was
paid to the approaches of New York and to the
Chesapeake, which latter region was devastated.
Destruction was carried on under the general orders
of the British Admiralty to &#8220;destroy and
lay waste all towns and districts of the United
States found accessive to the attacks of the British
armaments.&#8221; Hampton, in Virginia, was
thus sacked with a brutality which even the
very prejudiced British historian, James, called
&#8220;revolting to human nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>On February 24th the <i>Hornet</i>, which we left
taking leave of the <i>Montagu</i>, 74, at Bahia, was on
January 24th off Demarara. A brig, the <i>Espiegle</i>,
was inside the bar; another, standing in
for the port, was the <i>Peacock</i>. She was ready to
engage, and at 5:25 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> action opened; fourteen
minutes later the <i>Peacock</i> was a prize and
sinking. The two vessels were equal in size and
nearly equal in men, the <i>Hornet</i> having aboard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
135 to the <i>Peacock&#8217;s</i> 122. The <i>Hornet</i> was superior
in so far as carrying 32-pound carronades
to the <i>Peacock&#8217;s</i> 24&#8217;s; but weight of shot made no
difference for the <i>Peacock&#8217;s</i> guns did scarcely any
damage. Lawrence, overcrowded with prisoners,
returned to the United States, anchoring at
Holmes Hole on March 19th. Less than three
months later he was to die a defeated man,
aboard the <i>Chesapeake</i>, the victim of rashness
and over-confidence.</p>

<p>The <i>Chesapeake</i>, throughout her career an ill-omened
ship, had made a cruise under Captain
Evans, leaving Boston December 13, 1812, and
returning there April 9, 1813, having captured
five merchantmen. The term of enlistment of
the crew was up, and there being a difficulty over
prize money, most of the men refused to enlist.
Captain Evans on account of ill-health gave up
the command, and Lawrence was appointed in
his stead. He joined about the middle of May;
he left Boston Harbor to fight the <i>Shannon</i> a
fortnight later. Thus in two weeks he had to get
new officers and a new crew together and prepare
for sea. As for target practice, or for even the ordinary
&#8220;shaking down,&#8221; there was no opportunity
whatever. So new were some of the men
to their ship &#8220;that the last draft that arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
still had their hammocks and bags lying in the
boats stowed over the booms when the ship was
captured.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Privateering had now risen to such
prominence that the same difficulties were experienced
as to men as in the times of the Revolution,
when it was often impossible to man the
ships of the navy on account of the attractions
which the other and freer service offered. As a
consequence a large number of foreigners had
to be taken, including some forty British and a
number of Portuguese, these latter in the best
circumstances being what one would not select
from choice. In this case they were particularly
troublesome, a Portuguese boatswain&#8217;s mate
being the ringleader in what became almost a
mutiny on account of a question of prize money.
The first lieutenant, Page, was ill ashore; he was
replaced by a young lieutenant, Ludlow, who
had been third on the <i>Chesapeake&#8217;s</i> last cruise; the
third and fourth were only midshipmen with acting
appointments. To go to sea thus and fight a
battle with a ship which had been in commission
six and a half years, under a particularly able
captain, was simple madness. But this, driven
by over-confidence and perhaps an over-desire for
distinction, is what Lawrence did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Captain Philip Bowes Vere Broke, to give him
his full name, had commissioned the <i>Shannon</i>,
a new ship, on September 14, 1806. He was <i>sui
generis</i> in his own service, for he carried on target
practice twice a week, whereas the usual
custom in the British navy of the time was once
a year; his guns were furnished with sights,
which was also unusual, and he was a kindly
captain with the good-will of his crew, likewise
unusual in those days of free use of the
cat.</p>

<p>The two ships, without going into detail, were
practically of equal force, each carrying 52 guns.
The <i>Chesapeake</i> had 379 men; the <i>Shannon</i> 330,
30 of whom were new hands. The <i>Shannon</i> had
been off Boston for some time, when on June 1st
Broke sent a letter to Lawrence challenging him
to meet the <i>Shannon</i> later at a given point. It
is a great pity that this failed to reach Lawrence
in time.</p>

<p>On May 31st the <i>Chesapeake</i> dropped down to
the lower bay; the men were stationed at the
guns and were exercised at the battery. On
June 1st, a little after midday, she stood to sea
under all sails, even to studding sails. The
<i>Shannon</i> stood off shore under easy sail until
about eighteen miles from Boston Light, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
she awaited her foe, which had now also reduced
her canvas.</p>

<p>There is no need to go into the man&#339;uvres,
which can be found in many books. Lawrence
brought his ship so close that both vessels suffered
severely. He was soon mortally wounded
and the sailing master (who looked after the
handling of the ship under the captain&#8217;s orders)
was killed. The two most important officers
were thus removed early in the action. A heavy
explosion occurred in the <i>Chesapeake</i>, probably
by the ignition of cartridges lying on the deck.
At six o&#8217;clock the two ships came together, the
<i>Shannon&#8217;s</i> anchor catching in one of the after
ports of the <i>Chesapeake</i>. Broke now ordered
&#8220;away boarders.&#8221; The <i>Chesapeake&#8217;s</i> first lieutenant,
Ludlow, received a wound of which later
he died. Cox, the third lieutenant, coming up
from the main deck, was so unmanned by the
conditions of things that he turned and ran below,
an act for which he was later court-martialled
and dismissed from the service. As
Broke came aboard heading some twenty men,
the only opposition that could be offered at the
moment came from the nine marines, all that
were left unhurt of forty-four. Their commander,
Broom, and a corporal, were dead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
and both sergeants were wounded. The only
officer there at the moment was the chaplain,
Livermore, who fired his pistol at Broke, and
himself was severely wounded, in return, by a
sword cut from Broke. The large number of
mercenaries aboard had run below. Lieutenant
George Budd, stationed on the main deck, now
ran up, followed by some dozen men, and attacked
the boarders, killing the purser, Aldham,
and the captain&#8217;s clerk, Drum, but Budd was
soon wounded and knocked down the main
hatchway. The wounded Ludlow struggled to
the spar deck, and received another wound.
Broke himself showed brilliant courage in leading
his men and was severely wounded. Just
fifteen minutes after the action began, the
<i>Chesapeake&#8217;s</i> colors were hauled down. &#8220;Of her
379 men, 61 were killed or mortally wounded,
including her captain, first and fourth lieutenants,
the lieutenant commanding the marines,
the master, boatswain, and three midshipmen;
85 were wounded more or less severely, including
both her other lieutenants, five midshipmen,
and the chaplain; total, 148; the loss falling
entirely upon the American portion of the
crew. Of the <i>Shannon&#8217;s</i> men, 33 were killed
outright or died of their wounds, including her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
first lieutenant, purser, captain&#8217;s clerk, and one
midshipman, and 50 were wounded, including
the captain and boatswain; total, 83.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Chesapeake</i> was taken to Halifax. Lawrence
and Ludlow were buried there with every
honor. The remains of the former were later
taken to New York, where in the churchyard of
old Trinity they now lie. Lawrence&#8217;s dying
words: &#8220;Don&#8217;t give up the ship,&#8221; were later
blazoned on a flag flown by Perry on Lake Erie,
where the dead hero was to have his revenge,
for hero he was, however mistaken in judgment.
His fatal action was the ignoring of the value
of preparation in war. Discipline and training
are as necessary as valor, an axiom which our
people are only too slow to learn.</p>

<p>The result caused immense rejoicing in England.
It is the only naval action of the war
which to-day receives recognition there, and
I doubt if the British people in general, of the
present, know of any other. And while treating
of it, there is a persistent unfairness in ignoring
conditions of the <i>Chesapeake</i>; even in articles
which were written in 1913, the hundredth year
later, by historians from whom fairness might
be expected, no mention was made of them. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
is left to another and fairer foreigner, a Frenchman,
Admiral Jurien de la Gravi&egrave;re, the
most distinguished writer on naval affairs of
his nation, to tell the truth, when he said:
&#8220;Fortune was not fickle, she was merely logical.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later there was an action which was
really discreditable to us: that of the <i>Argus</i>, a
brig of 298 tons and 10 guns, against the British
<i>Pelican</i>, of 467 tons and 11 guns. The <i>Argus</i>
had been cruising in the English Channel &#8220;capturing
and burning ship after ship and creating
the greatest consternation among the London
merchants.&#8221; On August 13th she had captured
a brig laden with wine from Oporto, a success
which was to be apparently her undoing. Next
day she met the <i>Pelican</i>. The <i>Argus&#8217;s</i> captain,
Allen, was killed early in the action, as were
also two midshipmen; her first lieutenant was
wounded. The odds were against her, but not
to such degree as to account for the too slight
resistance later in the action. It is not unlikely,
as has been said by competent historians, that
the captured port had much to do with this.
The results of such actions had previously been
so markedly different that there is reason to
suspect this. The capture of the <i>Argus</i> was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
soon offset by that of the British brig <i>Boxer</i>, of
66 men and 14 guns, by the <i>Enterprise</i>, of 104
men and 16 guns. Captain Blyth of the
<i>Boxer</i> was killed early in the action, as was
also Lieutenant Burrows of the <i>Enterprise</i>.
The few remaining American brigs disappeared
by capture by much superior forces, most of
them by squadrons from which there was no
escape.</p>

<p>There had undoubtedly by this time been a
falling off in the character of the American
crews. The Atlantic now swarmed with privateers
which, as in our Revolution, attracted
the best men; the navy thus labored under a
severe handicap. The privateers did immense
damage to British commerce and caused the
British merchant to long for peace, but they
damaged our real naval interests. This damage
would have been more real had not the British
naval power now begun to tell in blockade,
which became one of absolute strictness. The
<i>United States</i> and the captured <i>Macedonian</i>,
which had been repaired and commissioned at
New York, got to New London by way of Hell
Gate, but were so strictly watched that they
remained there for the rest of the war. Naval
action was now, perforce, to be confined almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
entirely to the lakes, where it was momentous
in character. The fights on the ocean were
but exhibitions of ability and prowess; those
on the lakes were vital to the outcome of the
war.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> army efforts on the frontier of Canada had
been great failures. In the very beginning of
the war General William Hull, Governor of
Michigan, had been obliged to surrender his
small army at Detroit for the simple reason
that he was faced by starvation. He was tried
and sentenced to death, but was reprieved by
President Madison. But the fault was not
wholly Hull&#8217;s. It was, along with Hull&#8217;s age
and inefficiency, the ineptitude of our own administrative
and legislative authorities in Washington.
Our northern defence was thus to fall
upon the navy.</p>

<p>There was in 1813 no vessel of war on Lake
Erie, and but one, the <i>Oneida</i>, of 116 tons, built
four years before the war, on Ontario. The
British had long had a force on this lake, and
in 1812 there were six vessels, carrying in all
about 80 guns; the largest was the <i>Royal George</i>,
of 22. Had the British commander been competent
he could easily have controlled the lake.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
He attacked Sackett&#8217;s Harbor in July, but Lieutenant
Woolsey, commanding the <i>Oneida</i>, landed
his guns, and with the batteries thus formed beat
him off. Commodore Isaac Chauncey was
now, in August, 1812, sent to command both
lakes. Guns, officers, shipwrights, and stores
were transported from New York, and by November
a small fleet was ready. Before this,
however, Lieutenant L. D. Elliot, who had been
sent to Buffalo to look after Lake Erie, had made
a brilliant expedition against the <i>Detroit</i>, which
had been surrendered at the time of Hull&#8217;s disaster,
and another vessel, the <i>Caledonia</i>. Both
were captured on the Canada side of the lake
at Fort Erie by boarding, a small army detachment
assisting. The <i>Detroit</i> was burned.</p>

<p>On November 8th Chauncey made a spirited
attack on the harbor of Kingston, and kept up
his activities until navigation was closed by ice
early in December. The winter was spent in
building. A new ship, however, named the
<i>Madison</i>, had already (November 24th) been
launched at Sackett&#8217;s Harbor. Nine weeks
before her timber had stood in the forest.</p>

<p>By the opening of navigation in 1813 each
combatant had a considerable fleet on Lake
Ontario, though nearly all were but mere gunboats.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
The British, recognizing the immense
importance of control of the lakes, had selected
an able officer, Sir James L. Yeo, to command.
The outcome of the season&#8217;s operations, however,
for the detail of which one should look to
larger books, was that the Americans were left
in naval control. In the course of the summer
the hostile squadrons were three times engaged.
Chauncey&#8217;s courage and spirit have received,
and deserved, high praise for &#8220;the rapidity and
decision with which he created a force, as it
might be in a wilderness, the professional resources
which he discovered in attaining this
great end, and the combined gallantry and
prudence with which he man&#339;uvred before the
enemy ... while the intrepidity with
which he carried his own ship into action off
York has always been a subject of honest exultation
in the service to which he belongs.&#8221; This
high praise from one so able to judge as Fenimore
Cooper, himself in early life a naval officer,
holds to this day.</p>

<p>What Chauncey did on Lake Ontario, Perry
was to do, and much more, on Erie. He had
been reared in Preble&#8217;s school at Tripoli, but
by 1806 he was at Newport superintending the
building of some of Jefferson&#8217;s absurd gunboats,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
and to duty such as this he was kept for six
years, an inglorious inaction for such a spirit.
No attention was paid by a nerveless Secretary
of the Navy for his application for the lakes
until it was pressed by Chauncey, on which he
was ordered to report at Sackett&#8217;s Harbor with
his best men. Receiving his orders on February
17th, fifty men were on their way before
sunset; a hundred more followed, and Perry
himself on the 22d. He reached Sackett&#8217;s
Harbor on March 3d, and, after two weeks, was
ordered to Erie. Sailing-master Dobbins and
Noah Brown, master shipwright, already had
three gunboats well under way and keels laid
for two brigs. The timber for their construction
had been but a few days before trees in the
forest.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> But nothing had been provided in the
way of armament, cordage, stores, men, or
officers. These dribbled in through the appeals
and constant personal work of Perry. In five
months he had his little fleet fairly ready. On
August 10th he went in search of the British.
He had the brigs <i>Lawrence</i> and <i>Niagara</i>, of 20
guns each, and eight schooners carrying, one
three, the others two and one guns each. The
British commodore, Barclay, had the ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
<i>Detroit</i>, of 19 guns; the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, of 17; the
<i>Lady Prevost</i>, a schooner of 13, and three small
craft of 10, 3, and 1. Perry had in all 416 men fit
for duty; Barclay 440. On September 10th they
met.</p>

<p>The action began at 11:45. How Perry
fought his ship unsupported by the <i>Niagara</i>
until the <i>Lawrence</i> was a wreck and but 20 of
his 100 men were left unhurt; how he fired himself
the last heavy gun from his ship with the
help of the purser and chaplain, and then jumped
into a small boat, pulled by his brother and four
seamen, boarded the <i>Niagara</i>, took personal
command, and carried her to victory, make a
story of courage and resource unsurpassed in
any of the sea fights of history. Never did one
man more personify a victory.</p>

<p>The British flag was struck at 3:00 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, after
a most gallant struggle. Twenty-nine Americans
were killed or mortally wounded and 94
wounded. The British lost 41 killed and 94
wounded. The moral effect throughout the
country, which covered itself with bonfires and
rejoicings, was almost equal to that of the victory
of the <i>Constitution</i>. But besides this there
was the great concrete result of the evacuation
of Detroit and Michigan by the British and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
their occupancy by the Americans. To Perry&#8217;s
victory and Chauncey&#8217;s success on Lake Ontario
is due that we preserved our northwestern
frontier in the coming peace.</p>

<p>The winter of 1813-1814 was passed on Lake
Ontario by both antagonists in building ships
for the next campaign. The largest put afloat
at Sackett&#8217;s Harbor by the Americans, the
arming and equipping of which was under enormous
difficulties of transportation through the
then almost roadless forest, was the <i>Superior</i>,
of 62 guns; but the British built a much larger,
the <i>St. Lawrence</i>, of 112 guns. But it was not
until October 15th that she was in service, too
late in the season to affect the situation. Had
the war continued, the lakes would have been
the scene of naval operations greater than any
carried on by us upon the sea, aided curiously
enough by the British blockade of our coast,
which caused the transfer to the lakes of the
crews of the blockaded frigates. We shall hear
a little later of still another momentous battle
on our inland waters. For the moment we
turn again to the ocean.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It may be remembered that the <i>Essex</i>, under
Captain David Porter, was to form part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Bainbridge&#8217;s command when the latter left
Boston October 26, 1812, with the <i>Hornet</i>.
Porter was then in Delaware River. He left
on October 28th, but when he reached the rendezvous
appointed his consorts had gone. On
his way thither a British brig transport, the
<i>Nocton</i>, was captured, with $55,000 in specie,
which in the circumstances to come was to be a
most valuable aid. The prize was sent with a
crew of seventeen men to the United States,
but was overhauled by a frigate and captured
after passing Bermuda. Porter continued on
to the second rendezvous off Cape Frio, where
he arrived December 25th, four days before the
capture of the <i>Java</i>. Porter remained on the
Brazilian coast until near the end of January,
1813, when, hearing no news of his consorts, he
started for the Pacific, where for a full year he
was to cruise at will, capturing nearly every
British whaler in that ocean, arming some, destroying
others, and recapturing and protecting
our own. British commerce was swept from
what was then called the South Sea. The story
of this cruise in which the captain of the <i>Essex</i>
showed a surpassing boldness, energy, and resource
is one of the most romantic in history.</p>

<p>After nearly a year of continuous success in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
crippling the enemy&#8217;s commerce, during which
the <i>Essex</i> supported herself and armed her consorts
entirely from her prizes, Porter was desirous
of meeting a British man-of-war, and hearing
of the dispatch of the frigate <i>Phoebe</i>, of 36
guns, to the Pacific, he went to Valparaiso to
await her coming. But instead of one ship
came two, the <i>Cherub</i> accompanying the former.
This cruising in couples was the outcome of one
of the most remarkable orders ever issued by
the British Admiralty; its issuance was the
highest compliment ever paid any navy. The
order in full cannot be omitted, it read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty
having received intelligence that several American
ships-of-war are now at sea, I have their
lordships&#8217; commands to acquaint you therewith,
and that they do not conceive that any of his
Majesty&#8217;s frigates should attempt to engage,
single-handed, the larger class of American
ships, which, though maybe called frigates, are
of a size, complement, and weight of metal much
beyond that class and more resembling line-of-battle
ships.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the event of one of his Majesty&#8217;s frigates
under your orders falling in with one of these
ships, his captain should endeavor in the first
instance to secure the retreat of his Majesty&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
ship; but if he finds that he has an advantage
in sailing, he should endeavor to man&#339;uvre, and
keeping company with her, without coming to
action, in the hope of falling in with some other
of his Majesty&#8217;s ships, with whose assistance
the enemy might be attacked with a reasonable
hope of success.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is their lordships&#8217; further directions that
you make this known as soon as possible to the

</div>

<p>There is a delightfully ingenuous recognition
of the alarm that had been inspired by our victories
in the hope that we might be attacked by
two together, &#8220;with a reasonable hope of success.&#8221;
It was absurd to compare our frigates
with line-of-battle ships. They were undoubtedly
heavier than the usual frigate, though some
then in the British navy were quite as powerful.
But the fact that our ships were as good as any
of their class and better than most was all the
more to the credit of their designers. But the
<i>Constitution</i>, one of our best, was &#8220;but very
little more than <i>one half</i> the force of one of the
smallest <i>true</i> liners England possessed!&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>The <i>Essex</i> thus anchored at Valparaiso on
January 12, 1814. She had in company one
of her captured merchantmen, renamed the
<i>Essex Junior</i> with 60 men, ten long 6&#8217;s, and ten
18-pound carronades. She was of course wholly
unfit to meet a regular cruiser. On February
8th the <i>Phoebe</i>, 36, Captain Hillyar, and the
<i>Cherub</i>, 18, Captain Tucker, appeared. There
was an evident design on the part of Hillyar
to run aboard the <i>Essex</i>, but a very near approach
revealed the latter&#8217;s crew at her guns,
and he backed his yards, inquiring, meanwhile,
of Captain Porter&#8217;s health. Porter politely
replied, but warned Hillyar not to fall foul,
adding later, &#8220;You have no business where you
are; if you touch a rope-yarn of this ship I shall
board instantly.&#8221; It had been well had the
two ships fought then and there, for later the
<i>Essex</i> was to be taken at a much greater disadvantage.
The two British ships established
a blockade, and on Porter&#8217;s endeavor to fight
the <i>Phoebe</i> singly on February 27th she ran
down and joined her consort. On March
28th, however, Porter, who had already decided
to go to sea, parted his port cable in a gale of
wind and dragged his other anchor in the deep
roadstead and very difficult anchorage, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
the best of circumstances, at Valparaiso. He
had, by several trials, assured himself of the
superior speed of the <i>Essex</i>, and now, under way,
was sure of getting clear of his enemies. In
rounding the outermost headland of the bay, his
ship was struck by a heavy squall, which careened
her to the gunwale and carried away the maintopmast.
The <i>Essex</i> attempted to regain the
harbor, but an adverse wind and her crippled
condition prevented this. She thus stood northward
and anchored three miles north of the
town and half a mile from a small Chilean battery.
She was within pistol shot of the shore
and far within neutral waters. But our British
kindred have never recked of such small
matters as neutrality unless such stickling
served their purpose. Both British ships thus
stood in with flags and mottoes at every masthead,
deliberately took position out of range of
the short-range carronades of the <i>Essex</i> (which
carried but about 300 yards), and opened fire.
The time was 4:00 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Now was made apparent
the justice of Porter&#8217;s demand for a battery
of long-range guns which he had made before
leaving the United States, but which was refused
him. He thus had to fight the action
with but his six long 12-pounders. The result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
was the loss of the ship, but never was ship more
gallantly fought. Near the end she caught fire
and a quantity of powder exploded below.
Many men were knocked overboard and some,
jumping into the water to swim ashore when
the ship had become a total wreck, succeeded.
At 6:20 the ship was surrendered. Of the 255
of the crew 58 had been killed, 66 wounded,
and 31 drowned; 24 reached the shore. The
<i>Phoebe</i> had lost 4 killed, including her first
lieutenant, and 7 wounded; the <i>Cherub</i> 1 killed
and 3 wounded. Such were the benefits of
being able to fight at long taw. Captain
Hillyar is not to be blamed for so doing; his
business was to capture the <i>Essex</i>, and he did
this with as little loss to himself and consort as
might be. But all the honors were with the
American. Hillyar&#8217;s flagrant violation of the
neutrality of Chile was in British eyes but an
easily condoned incident, and he received all
the praise and regard which would have been
due for taking the <i>Essex</i> in fairest fight. He
gave at least every credit to the brave defenders
of our ship. As usual in modern British accounts
of this notable battle, no reference is
made to the crippled state of the <i>Essex</i>, nor to
her being in neutral waters, nor to the fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
she had a battery incomparably inferior in
range, nor that two ships were employed against
one to do the work. The &#8220;American frigate
<i>Essex</i> was captured by the British frigate
<i>Phoebe</i>,&#8221; and British self-respect thereby saved.</p>

<p>One officer who did his duty bravely and well
in the <i>Essex</i>, as did all, was later to achieve fame
as the most brilliant naval officer of his time:
David Glasgow Farragut, then aged twelve
years and eight months. Farragut continued
his battle even after the surrender in a stand-up
fight aboard the <i>Phoebe</i> for the preservation of
his pet young pig, Murphy, an animal always a
favorite of sailors. He won.</p>

<p>The <i>Constellation</i>, of noble record, was a victim
of the blockade, and, beyond aiding in the
defence of Norfolk, had to remain passive. The
<i>Adams</i>, after a successful cruise so far as affecting
the enemy&#8217;s trade very seriously, had to be
burned while careened in the Penobscot to escape
capture by an overwhelming force. The
<i>Peacock</i>, of 11 guns, captured the British brig
<i>Epervier</i>, of 9, with $118,000 in specie aboard,
on April 29, 1814. The <i>Wasp</i>, 22, in a daring and
successful cruise of destruction in the English
Channel, met and captured on June 28th the
British <i>Reindeer</i>, 18, of considerably less force,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
in an action which was honorable to the captains
and crews of both ships. On September
1st, after a brilliant night action, she captured
the <i>Avon</i>, of 18 guns. The <i>Wasp</i> was driven
off by the approach of three new antagonists,
who had to go to the assistance of the <i>Avon</i>,
which sank after the removal of several of her
crew. The <i>Wasp</i>, after taking a number of
prizes, spoke on October 4th a Swedish brig and
received from her Lieutenant McKnight and
Master&#8217;s Mate Lyman, both on their way home
from the <i>Essex</i>. This was the last ever heard
of her and her brilliant and lamented captain.
The last memento of her, besides that of October
9th in the journal of the Swedish brig, the
<i>Adonis</i>, was a prize, the <i>Atlanta</i>, which reached
Savannah November 4th under Midshipman
Geisinger.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was to be one other battle on the lakes,
that of Lake Champlain, which was to have
momentous consequences quite equal to that of
Lake Erie, and place the name of young Thomas
MacDonough high on the list of benefactors of
his country. MacDonough, on September 28,
1812, had been directed to proceed immediately
and take command on the lake, the control
having previously been under a young lieutenant,
Sydney Smith. There was, however, little
to command. The Americans had three armed
sloops and a few small gunboats and galleys (the
latter propelled only by oars). But this was
larger than that of the British, until on June
3, 1813, two of the sloops, the <i>Growler</i> and the
<i>Eagle</i>, in pursuit of some of the British flotilla
which had ventured into the American part of
the lake, found themselves in the narrow reaches
of the north end with a south wind against
which it was impossible to work back. Here
they were attacked both by gunboats and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
troops on both shores of the narrow waters, and
had to surrender. Thenceforward, until May,
1814, the British by the addition of the captured
American sloops were in control. Manned
temporarily by seamen from the sloop-of-war
<i>Wasp</i> at Quebec, the British flotilla raided
Plattsburgh on June 30, 1813, destroyed the
public buildings there and at Swanton in Vermont,
and threatened the destruction of the
new vessels building by MacDonough. On
April 11, 1814, he launched the ship <i>Saratoga</i>.
By the end of May he was afloat with the <i>Saratoga</i>,
of 26 guns, 8 of which were long 24-pounders,
the remainder being 32 and 42 pounder
carronades; the schooner <i>Ticonderoga</i>, the sloop
<i>Preble</i>, and ten galleys. Once more the Americans
were in control. The British, however,
were urging forward with all haste, to assist
in the coming invasion, a ship much more than
the <i>Saratoga&#8217;s</i> equal. This was the <i>Confiance</i>,
of 37 guns, 27 of which were long 24-pounders
and the others carronades of 24 and 32 pounds.
On August 25th she was launched. With her
tonnage of over 1,200 against the 734 of
the <i>Saratoga</i> and with her great superiority in
long guns, she was an enemy to be reckoned
with.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>The European wars had now closed. Four
brigades of Wellington&#8217;s army had been sent to
Canada from Bordeaux. They came with
orders to &#8220;give immediate protection to his
Majesty&#8217;s possessions in America,&#8221; by the entire
destruction of Sackett&#8217;s Harbor and of the
naval establishments on Lake Erie and Lake
Champlain.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The governor-general of Canada, Sir George
Prevost, who also was in command of the army,
now had, exclusive of officers, 29,437 men,
nearly all of whom were regulars seasoned by
years of service under Wellington. He decided
to advance by the west side of the lake reporting
that as &#8220;Vermont has shown a disinclination to
the war, and, as it is sending in specie and provisions,
I will confine offensive operations to the
west side of Lake Champlain.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>On August 31st Prevost moved south with an
army variously estimated at from 11,000 to
14,000 men. The American army under General
Alexander Macomb was less than 2,000, but by
September 4th came in 700 militia from the
neighborhood, and by the 11th &#8220;other militia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
from New York and volunteers from Vermont ...
in encouraging contrast to their fellow-citizens
who were making money by abetting
the enemy.&#8221; The British entered Plattsburgh
on the 6th. Macomb retreated across the
Saranac, a small, fordable river on which the
town stands, and entrenched. Had Prevost
had the courage to attack Macomb with his
large and seasoned army, Macdonough would
have had either to withdraw up the lake or risk a
battle in the open lake, where the <i>Confiance</i> would
have been more than a match for his whole
squadron. He had anchored under Cumberland
Head, somewhat over a mile from the west
shore with the <i>Eagle</i>, <i>Saratoga</i>, <i>Ticonderoga</i>,
and <i>Preble</i> in a line from north to south in the
order named. West of this line were his ten
gunboats. His fourteen vessels totalled but
2,244 tons, with 86 guns and 882 men. The
British commodore, Downie, had sixteen vessels,
amounting in all to 2,402 tons, with 92 guns and
937 men, but his flagship, as mentioned, was
nearly twice the size and force of the <i>Saratoga</i>.</p>

<p>But now came to the aid of the Americans the
nervousness of the incapable British general who
insisted upon immediate action by the British
squadron in his support. The <i>Confiance</i> had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
only been launched on August 25th; to make
her ready for action in seventeen days was a task
of Hercules, and that she was, in a way, made
ready, reflects the highest credit upon the energy
and ability of those in charge. Commodore
Downie had joined only on September 2d; the
crew had been hastily gathered from ships at
Quebec, the last detachment coming aboard only
the night but one before the battle. The men
were thus largely unknown to the officers and to
one another. The ship hauled into the stream on
September 7th with the artificers still hard at
work on the hundreds of fittings so necessary in
the equipment of a man-of-war. They did not
leave her until two hours before the beginning
of battle. The situation of unpreparedness was
very comparable to that of the <i>Chesapeake</i> in like
circumstances, except that Macdonough&#8217;s own
ship had been launched but four months earlier.</p>

<p>Prevost, by the fact of his position as governor-general,
was in a position to command
obedience, and his peremptory insistence caused
Downie to move earlier than he should, undoubtedly
against the latter&#8217;s better judgment.
He thus on the morning of September 11, 1814,
stood up the narrow reaches of the northern
part of the lake, with a fair wind from the northeast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
He had every reason to expect a simultaneous
attack by Prevost on the American
troops, but none came. Having passed Cumberland
Head, it was too late to await any action by
Prevost.</p>

<p>Macdonough had so admirably chosen his
position that the British in rounding Cumberland
Head were forced to stand nearly northwest
and almost head on to the American line.
They were thus subjected to a raking fire
(lengthwise of the ship). The <i>Confiance</i>, being
in the lead and having thus a concentration
upon her of the American fire, suffered severely
before anchoring within five hundred yards
of the line. Within fifteen minutes her captain
was dead. The day was finally won by
&#8220;winding&#8221; the <i>Saratoga</i> (turning her end for
end), for which excellent previous arrangements
had been made. A new and, in great degree, uninjured
broadside was thus brought into use,
and shortly after, about 11, the <i>Confiance</i> hauled
down her colors. The whole action lasted, by
Macdonough&#8217;s report, two hours and twenty
minutes.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>The immediate effect of the victory was
Prevost&#8217;s retreat without delay into Canada.
The general result was the end of the war, of
which it was really the &#8220;decisive&#8221; battle. No
longer could Castlereagh, the British foreign
minister, hold Great Britain &#8220;entitled to claim
the use of the lakes as a military barrier.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>To Macdonough and Perry, the former under
thirty-one, the latter but twenty-eight years old
at the time of their victories, our country owes
the preservation of its northern boundaries at
the coming peace. It is a great debt.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The war</span> had no more than begun when the
question of peace was being considered. The
United States had gone to war for two causes:
the &#8220;Orders in Council&#8221; which bore so heavily
upon our shipping; and the impressment of our
seamen. The former were revoked on June
23d, five days after the declaration of war by
Congress; peace was to be made without even a
mention of the latter.</p>

<p>Actual steps toward peace were taken through
Russia even as early as September, 1812. The
whole is a long story, but on November 4th
a direct negotiation was offered by England
which was accepted by the United States on
January 5, 1814, and commissioners were appointed,
with Ghent as the place of meeting. It
is well that action was thus early, for by April
Great Britain&#8217;s hands were largely free in
Europe, and she could turn her efforts more
freely upon America, and this she did in the expedition
against Louisiana (which was to end in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
almost unequalled disaster), and in the abortive
invasion turned back by Macdonough&#8217;s victory.
The British state of mind was expressed in a
letter from Gallatin, then in London, to Monroe,
the Secretary of State: &#8220;You may rest assured,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;of the general hostile spirit of this
nation, and of its wish to inflict serious injury
upon the United States; that no resistance can
be expected from Europe; and that no better
terms will be obtained than the <i>status ante
bellum</i>.&#8221; And so it turned out. On Christmas
Eve, 1814, peace was signed, and though impressment
was ignored, it was never again to be
attempted. Nor was there cause, for there was
not to be a naval war upon the ocean in which
Britain was to be engaged for a hundred years.</p>

<p>Before hostilities on the water came to an end
there were, however, to be several notable naval
events, one of the most remarkable being the
defence on September 26, 1814, of the privateer
<i>General Armstrong</i>, Captain Reid, at Fayal,
Azores, against a boat attack from three British
ships, the <i>Plantagenet</i>, 74; <i>Rota</i>, 38; and
<i>Carnation</i>, 18. The British were repulsed with
the loss of 34 killed and 86 wounded. The next
day the <i>Carnation</i> stood in to attack alone, and
was driven off; but with a 74 present besides two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
other ships, the question of saving the little
vessel was hopeless, and she was scuttled, the
crew escaping ashore.</p>

<p>In those days news travelled slowly, and thus
it was that after the peace the <i>President</i>, one of a
squadron under Commodore Decatur, separated
from her consorts, was captured, after she had
driven off the <i>Endymion</i> frigate, by the squadron
accompanying the latter. On February 20,
1815, the <i>Cyane</i> and <i>Levant</i>, sloops-of-war, were
captured in a night action, 300 miles from
Madeira, by the <i>Constitution</i>, Captain Stewart,
who was to be the instrument of trouble many
years after to Britain, through his grandfatherhood
of Charles Stewart Parnell.</p>

<p>This action was remarkable for the brilliant
handling of Stewart&#8217;s ship. The <i>Levant</i> was recaptured
by a British squadron at Porto Praya,
in the Cape Verdes, where she had taken refuge
against the British squadron, which had vainly
chased the <i>Constitution</i>. It was another instance,
added to those of the <i>Essex</i> and the <i>General
Armstrong</i>, of the disregard of the English of a
neutrality so highly esteemed in these latter
days.</p>

<p>The capture, on March 23d, of the British
<i>Penguin</i> by the <i>Hornet</i>, Captain Biddle, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
equal force, was the last real action of the war,
that of the <i>Peacock</i> and British <i>Nautilus</i> in the
Indian Ocean on June 30th, on account of the
former&#8217;s superiority in force, not calling for any
but mere mention.</p>

<p>But the history of the War of 1812 cannot
close without mention of the crowning victory on
land, New Orleans, on January 8, 1815. In
this, perhaps the severest and completest repulse
ever suffered by a British army, the navy bore
a most important part, for by its efforts was
prevented the flanking of General Jackson&#8217;s
force from the river. The naval vessels, the
<i>Louisiana</i>, with Commodore Patterson, and the
<i>Caroline</i>, Lieutenant J. D. Henley, controlled
the river situation on the British left flank until
the latter was burned by hot shot from the
British trenches. The <i>Louisiana</i> then shifted to
cover Jackson&#8217;s right. The situation forced
the British to transport siege pieces from the
fleet, seventy miles away; this gave time for
Jackson to strengthen his position and time for
reinforcements to join him. The <i>Louisiana&#8217;s</i>
guns were now landed and a battery established
which would flank the newly established British
battery as well as their attacking columns; the
result was the destruction of the British battery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
soon after it had opened fire. The British
move, on the day of the main attack, to capture
the <i>Louisiana&#8217;s</i> battery on the right bank of the
river, was finally successful through the flight of
the supporting militia, but it was too late; the
naval battery had already assisted in the bloody
repulse of the main body, and there was nothing
left to the capturing party but withdrawal.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The war was now ended. It had been a
second War of Independence, which had released
America from the strong British influence
which had still obtained and had established a
real national spirit. The world recognized the
birth of a new power upon the ocean, which the
future was to reckon with, though America herself
was slow to accept her new situation. We
had, however, afloat in 1815, three line-of-battle
ships, the <i>Washington</i>, <i>Independence</i>, and <i>Franklin</i>,
and in this year we were to end, as has already
been mentioned, our Barbary troubles forever by
the action of Decatur in command of the largest
fleet we were to have at sea for many years. We
began a new life with a self-respect which had
needed a war for its revival.</p>

<p>There was one note at least of dissatisfaction
over the peace. The London <i>Times</i>, commenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
in its issue of December 30, 1814, said: &#8220;We
have retired from the combat with the stripes
yet bleeding on our backs. Even yet, however,
if we could but close the war with some great
naval triumph, the reputation of our maritime
greatness might be partially restored. But to
say that it has not hitherto suffered in the
estimation of all Europe, and, what is worse, of
America herself, is to belie common sense and
universal experience. &#8216;Two or three of our ships
have struck to a force vastly inferior!&#8217; No;
not two or three, but many on the ocean and
whole squadrons on the lakes; and the numbers
are to be viewed with relation to the comparative
magnitude of the two navies. Scarcely is there
an American ship-of-war which has not to boast
a victory over the British flag; scarcely one
British ship in thirty or forty that has beaten
an American. With the bravest seamen and
the most powerful navy in the world, we retire
from the contest when the balance of defeat is so
heavily against us.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> And more defeats were
yet to come. Perhaps yet more would have
come, for just as the war closed, the first war-steamer
to be built for over ten years, the
<i>Fulton</i>, was ready for sea. With a double hull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
of such thickness as to be impervious to harm
from any but the heaviest guns, moved by a
wheel in the middle which was protected from
shot, it seems almost a pity that she should not
have been tried with her two 100-pound guns
upon the ships blockading New York. But
even as it was America had good reason to be
well satisfied with the work of her navy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> thirty-one years was to pass before the
United States was again to be at war with a
foreign power, and then with Mexico&mdash;which
had no navy&mdash;they were far from being years
of idleness or want of deeds accomplished.</p>

<p>Our flag was now shown in every sea and with
the weight and authority which success always
carries. Thus N. P. Willis, who in the early
thirties was the guest of wardroom officers of
the flagship in the Mediterranean, says in his

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;From the comparisons I have made between
our own ships and the ships-of-war of other
nations, I think we may well be proud of our
navy. I had learned in Europe long before
joining the <i>United States</i> that the respect we
exact from foreigners is paid more to America
afloat than to a continent they think as far off at
least as the moon. They see our men-of-war
and they know very well what they have done
and, from the appearance and character of our
officers, what they might do again&mdash;and there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
a tangibility in the deductions from knowledge
and eyesight which beats books and statistics.
I have heard Englishmen deny one by one every
claim we have to political and moral superiority,
but I have found none illiberal enough to refuse
a compliment&mdash;and a handsome one&mdash;to Yankee
ships.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The world was yet a world of piracy, and the
extirpation of these wolves of the sea was a work
which, when finished in the Mediterranean and
in the West Indies, was to continue in the Far
East to our own day. The situation, however,
in the Caribbean Sea and its adjacent waters was
particularly serious from the anarchic conditions
arising through the revolt of Spain&#8217;s American
dominions, with the exception of Cuba, Puerto
Rico, and Mexico, and this last was to join in
the upheaval in 1821. But all became nests of
piracy. The fault in the beginning was with
our own Government, which had allowed too
freely the fitting out of vessels, usually schooners,
in our ports which sailed away for Venezuela or
Argentina and there took out letters of marque
and flew the insurgent flags. They captured not
only Spanish vessels, but whatever seemed likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
prize, and our own ships suffered as well as
others. Galveston and Matagorda had also for
years after the peace of 1815 been bases of piracy
under the claim of patriotism. Our war with
England had in fact so developed the greed in
privateering that the more adventurous kept it
up in the new form. Florida, Louisiana, Texas,
and Mexico at the time thus bred pirates much
as ill-conditioned ponds breed mosquitoes.
When Mexico declared independence in 1821
and there was nothing left to Spain but Cuba and
Puerto Rico, numerous privateers were fitted
out from there against the privateers of the
patriots, and the former became in turn as bad
as the latter. Havana itself was one of the
strongholds of these villains, the captain-general
sharing in the profits, and each of the many
curiously formed, deep, bottlelike harbors of
Cuba was a pirate refuge. For nine years, from
1817 to 1826, the navy was busily engaged in
suppressing these marauders, and it was on such
duty, in 1819, that Commodore Oliver Hazard
Perry, in command of a squadron in the Caribbean,
lost his life through yellow fever caught in
the Orinoco. He was but thirty-four years old.</p>

<p>But while this work had its losses, it had also
great uses, besides protecting the commercial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
world, in serving as a school for the greatest
admiral of his or any time in fact, and for
another great officer who was bound to him by
peculiarly romantic ties. These were Farragut
and Porter, who forty or more years later were
to come to such distinguished fame. The story
needs a telling.</p>

<p>The first Porter, a merchant captain, born in
Massachusetts in 1727, had two sons, of whom
David was the later admiral&#8217;s grandfather.
This grandfather served as a privateersman,
was a captain in the Massachusetts state navy
in the Revolution, was captured and confined in
the Jersey prison ship, escaped, and served at
sea for the rest of the war. Becoming again a
merchant captain, his bold and successful resistance
to the impressment of his men by a
British man-of-war in Santo Domingo led, when
the navy came to life in 1794, to his appointment
as a sailing master. He was in command of the
naval station at New Orleans when in 1808,
having had a sunstroke while fishing on Lake
Ponchartrian, he was found and cared for by
George Farragut, a sailing master in the navy who
lived on the borders of the lake. Porter died, and
Mrs. Farragut dying of yellow fever, both were
buried on the same day, June 22, 1808.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>Some time after, the late Porter&#8217;s son David,
whom we have met herein as the captain of the
famous <i>Essex</i>, took charge of the New Orleans
station, and in recognition of the great kindness
of the Farragut family offered to adopt one of
the motherless boys and train him for the navy.
It was thus that the future victor at New
Orleans and at Mobile Bay had his start in life.
Farragut, born July 5, 1801, was taken into
Porter&#8217;s family, and on December 17, 1810,
received his appointment as midshipman. He
was then just nine years five months and twelve
days old.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> In 1811 he was at sea with Porter
in the <i>Essex</i> and took a very active and valorous
part in the famous battle in 1814 in which she
was overcome by great odds. It was in the
year before this (1813) that the youngest David
Porter was born. The careers of the two men
were to be curiously linked through life, and the
period of piracy mentioned was one which was
to be largely formative of their characters.
Both were to rise to the highest honors in their
profession and leave great and worthy names.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Their stories make books which all boys, young
or old, should read and thereby stir their blood.</p>

<p>By 1822 it had become necessary to employ a
large force on the Caribbean, and Commodore
Porter (he of the <i>Essex</i>) was selected for the
command. By 1826 piracy in those waters was
at an end, but the righteous punishment given
some of the depredators at Cape Fajardo at the
eastern end of Puerto Rico, though not at all
excessive, was, as an invasion of Spanish territory,
made a cause of investigation, and Porter&#8217;s
conduct was found &#8220;censurable&#8221; by the court-martial
before which the matter was brought.
This was too much for Porter&#8217;s high spirit, and
he at once resigned from the navy and never
thereafter would speak to a member of the court.
In 1826 he became commander-in-chief of the
then somewhat considerable Mexican navy,
Mexico now being at war with Spain, and it was
as a midshipman in this service that the younger
Porter, now thirteen, began his sea-going life.
He was, in 1828, in one of the severest and
bloodiest battles of his career, that of the brig
<i>Guerr&eacute;ro</i>, in which he was serving, with the
Spanish frigate <i>Lealtad</i>, west of Havana. His
career as a Mexican midshipman ended in imprisonment,
a quick release, and an appointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
as midshipman in our own navy, his father, the
commodore, having thrown up his Mexican
appointment. The latter was to end his career
as our first minister to Turkey, to which post
he was appointed by President Jackson, to whom
Porter was a man after his own heart. He ended
his life, than which there have been few of such
romantic and gallant exploit, at Constantinople
on March 28, 1843, at the age of sixty-three, and
after fourteen years&#8217; service as minister.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following years of the navy until the
Mexican War were thus years of commerce-protecting
and of the usual routine of naval duty
varied by punitive expeditions in the East and
in the Pacific. There was the well-known exploring
expedition of Lieutenant Wilkes in the
years 1838-1842, the discoveries of which were
for years to be minimized by British jealousy,
but which are now recognized at their full value;
the establishment of the Naval Observatory,
1842; of the Naval Academy in 1845; and the
introduction of steam vessels, the first to see
actual service in our navy being a small purchased
vessel, the <i>Sea Gull</i>, used against the
pirates of Cuba in 1823.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Throughout the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
period, too, of the Seminole War in Florida the
navy did its share in a not overglorious but most
trying duty.</p>

<p>War was declared with Mexico on May 12,
1846. The share of the navy in the occupancy
of the east coast of the country, apart from its
landing a very efficient battery of heavy guns at
Vera Cruz, which assisted materially in a quick
surrender of the place, was not of very great
importance beyond occupying all the other
towns of the coast, a duty in every case gallantly
performed. The importance of naval action in
the Pacific was far different, for it secured to us
California, then a part of Mexico. Whatever the
later official statements as to British intent, or non-intent,
it was well that our ships were on the ground
first and in possession; in any case our action on
the California coast forestalled any question.</p>

<p>There was from the treaty of peace with
Mexico, February 2, 1848, to our next and greatest
war, an interval of but thirteen years. This
was one of the periods of greatest transition in
which the ships and guns which had existed for
over two hundred years with but moderate change
were to take a long step to complete transformation,
from sail to steam, and from the smooth-bore
to the rifle. In the matter of guns, though,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
we were much slower to change than was Europe.
We were to carry aboard our ships, during the
Civil War and for long after, the smooth-bore
Dahlgren gun, so called from the bottlelike form
given it by the inventor, Commander (later
Rear-Admiral) J. A. Dahlgren.</p>

<p>One by one, or at most by occasional twos, the
new-fangled idea&mdash;the steamship&mdash;had made its
way. In 1837 had been built the <i>Fulton</i>, of 4
guns; in 1841, the <i>Missouri</i>, which was to perish
by fire at Gibraltar but two years later, 1843;
and the <i>Mississippi</i>, a sister ship, which after
many years of honorable service was to find her
grave in the river of her name at Port Hudson on
March 14, 1863; in 1843 was built our first screw
steamer, the <i>Princeton</i>; in 1844 at Erie our first
iron steamer, the <i>Michigan</i>, for service on the
lakes, where she cruised for many years and
became in lapse of time a curiosity; in 1848, the
<i>Saranac</i>; and in 1850 the two fine old side-wheel
frigates, the <i>Susquehanna</i> and the <i>Powhatan</i>. By
1855 we were building the five frigates, <i>Wabash</i>,
<i>Roanoke</i>, <i>Colorado</i>, <i>Merrimac</i>, and <i>Minnesota</i>, the
finest of their time, but which except the <i>Merrimac</i>,
transformed into an ironclad, were to cut no
figure in the coming Civil War on account of their
deep draft. Their time had passed even by 1861.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> there were many mutterings of the coming
tempest in the decade 1850-1860, the navy,
whose duty, unaffected by internal politics, lay
abroad, went its even tenor. We had come to
the verge of war with Spain in 1852 over the
case of the <i>Black Warrior</i>. There had been
filibustering expeditions and the slave trade to
look after; threatenings of difficulties with
England; a successful expedition to Paraguay in
1858 and 1859 to demand reparation for the
firing upon the United States steamer <i>Water
Witch</i>; and most notable and most momentous
of all, the expedition, 1852-1854, resulting in the
opening of Japan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile was swiftly gathering the storm of
secession. Despite the Kansas war, the John
Brown raid, and fierce political antagonisms, the
illimitable optimism of the American people
would not admit the idea of danger until the
convulsion was upon them. So little could our
people in 1860 recognize that they were rapidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
being carried into the abyss of war, that in the
last days of the Congress which closed on June
25th of that year, &#8220;at the instance of Sherman,
of Ohio, the estimate for repairs and equipment
of the navy was cut down a million....
Senator Pugh, of the same state, could say: &#8216;I
think we have spent enough money on the navy,
certainly for the service it has rendered, and for
one I shall vote against building a single ship
under any pretence at all.&#8217; The blatant Lovejoy,
in the face of the rising storm, said: &#8216;I am
tired of appropriating money for the army and
navy when absolutely they are of no use whatever ...
I want to strike a blow at this
whole navy expenditure and let the navy go out
of existence.... Let us blow the whole
thing up! Let these vessels rot, and when we
want vessels to fight, we can get mercantile
vessels and arm them with our citizens.&#8217;...
The whole existing steam navy consisted of but
twenty-three vessels which could be called
efficient and thirteen which were worthless, and
while there was a willingness and effort on the
part of the Northern senators and representatives
to add to the force, it was put wholly upon
the ground of the suppression of the slave trade.
Morse, of Maine, the chairman of the Naval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
Committee in the House, urged that the increase
should take the form of a purchase of small
steamers of six to nine feet draught for African
service. There appears no glimmering in the
mind of any one of the speakers of the coming of
a great war, then but nine months distant, and
in which the North could not have been successful
had it not been for the throttling of the
blockade and the occupancy of the Mississippi.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Besides the legislative incapacity just mentioned,
and the equally inept legislation which
for ten years or more had quarrelled over carrying
slavery into impossible regions, our administrative
departments were absurdly inefficient
and, in the case of the War Department, corrupt,
in that the Secretary of War had steadily
been distributing arms, such as they were, in
the South. Never did the government of a
great country go to war under such conditions
of ineptitude as did ours. Buchanan&#8217;s effort
to reinforce Fort Sumter had come to grief
through the folly of General Scott, who had
caused the change from the heavily armed war-steamer,
<i>Brooklyn</i>, lying at Fort Monroe, to the
merchant steamer, <i>Star of the West</i>. Had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
<i>Brooklyn</i> gone, as was intended, the Confederates
would not have dared to fire upon her. Had
they done so, the raw militia which had never
before fired a cannon would have been driven
from their improvised battery, and Charleston
harbor would have been ours permanently. It
was the same when Mr. Lincoln made the second
effort and the <i>Powhatan</i> was diverted to Pensacola
through the officiousness of the Secretary
of State, who meddled with affairs with which
he had nothing to do and caused orders to be
sent to the <i>Powhatan</i> without the knowledge of
the Secretary of the Navy.</p>

<p>Our officers from the South resigned by scores,
and our Southern navy yards, Norfolk and
Pensacola, left under the command of aged
officers, were surrendered with enormous loss,
particularly in cannon, many hundreds of which
thus went to arm the Southern batteries on the
coast and more particularly on the Mississippi.
The following ships were burned and scuttled
at Norfolk on April 20, 1861: the <i>Pennsylvania</i>,
120; <i>Columbus</i>, 74; <i>Delaware</i>, 74; <i>Raritan</i>, 44;
<i>Columbia</i>, 44; <i>Merrimac</i>, 40; <i>Germantown</i>, 20;
<i>Plymouth</i>, 20, and <i>Dolphin</i>, 10. All but the
<i>Merrimac</i> were sailing ships and thus, with this
exception, no great loss. General Scott, weakened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
by age, was still commander-in-chief, and
failed to man the Southern forts, which, properly,
should have been done in the first days
of secession, and every port of the South thus
held by the Federal Government. In such case
there could have been no war. As it was, a few
militia marched in and took possession against
what was only, in most cases, a sergeant-in-charge.
Never was any government so thoroughly
inefficient, and it was the inefficiency of
years of ineptitude, not of a day.</p>

<p>But the South occupied every fort and began
war. To the trained strategist the action to be
taken so far as the navy was concerned was
simple: to blockade every port and to occupy
the Mississippi. The former would cut off the
importation of military supplies, in which the
South was terribly deficient; the latter would cut
the Confederacy in twain and isolate the great
food supply of her armies. The former of
course to be effective was a matter of ships, and
it took time to supply these; the latter could
and should have been done at once, before the
defences of the Mississippi were thoroughly established
and organized as they were to be.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the work of blockade is
evident in the fact &#8220;that there were 185 harbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
and river openings in the Confederate coastline....
This coastline extended from
Alexandria, Virginia, to the Mexican port of
Matamoros, which lies forty miles up the Rio
Grande. The Continental line so measured was
3,549 miles long.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Our few ships were scattered
over the world. There were but three
instantly available. During the war these were
increased to 600 by building and by purchasing
everything which could steam and carry a gun,
down to ferry-boats. We improvised a great
navy&mdash;of a kind. It could not, however, until
our ironclad fleet of turreted vessels were built,
have stood for a moment before a great regular
force. Fortunately, foreign complications were
avoided and we had to do with a government
which itself had to improvise such vessels as it
could or get them from England and France,
and the former was full willing until she came
herself to the verge of war on that account.
She launched the <i>Alabama</i> and <i>Shenandoah</i>
which, though officered by Southerners, were
manned by Englishmen, and built blockade
runners by the hundreds, which kept the Confederacy
alive.</p>

<p>By great good fortune the Secretary of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
Navy, Gideon Welles, himself a civilian of
fine mind and good hard sense, though with no
initiative and with no knowledge of war, was
supplemented by an Assistant-Secretary, Gustavus
V. Fox, a former officer of the navy, of
strong character and great energy. He was to
become practically a chief-of-staff. There had
been no plan of operations, no laying down of a
broad scheme such as, had there been any real
organization of the services, there would have
been by a general staff. Congress has resisted
such an organization in the navy to this day.
Even the Civil War has not been able to teach
it the wisdom of this. Thus, admits Mr. Welles
himself, &#8220;but for some redeeming successes at
Hatteras and Port Royal the whole belligerent
operations of 1861 would have been pronounced
weak and imbecile failures.&#8221;</p>

<p>The work of strengthening the blockade was
carried on with great energy. By building and
purchasing every available steam vessel in the
country which could carry a gun, there were
by December, 1864, 559 steam vessels in the
service, carrying 3,760 guns and about 51,000
men. Fortunately there had been enough
freedom from prejudice to accept the plans of
Ericsson for building the <i>Monitor</i>, which appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
in the very nick of time, to save our
wooden fleet from total destruction in Hampton
Roads by the <i>Virginia</i>, so much better known
under her original name of the <i>Merrimac</i>, which
had been one of the frigates so ignominiously
sunk at Norfolk on the surrender of that yard,
raised, and with immense energy converted by
the Confederates into a formidable ironclad.
The story of the <i>Monitor&#8217;s</i> battle, on March
9, 1862, under Worden; his almost fatal wounding;
and the continuance of the fight to victory
by Dana Greene, her young first lieutenant, a
mere boy, is among the stories which will last
forever.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Hatteras inlet had been taken and occupied
on August 28, 1861; Port Royal on November
7th.</p>

<p>There was one man at least, David D. Porter,
yet only a lieutenant at the age of forty-nine,
who, when blockading, July, 1861, the passes of
the river in the <i>Powhatan</i>, saw the importance
and feasibility of occupying the Mississippi.
Porter, north again in November, brought the
subject before the Navy Department, and urged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
as commander of the expedition his adopted
brother, Farragut, senior to Porter in age by
thirteen years, and far his superior in rank.</p>

<p>Farragut had left Norfolk declaring, it is
reported, at a meeting of Southern naval officers,
some of whom were bound to him by his marriage
to a Norfolk wife: &#8220;Gentlemen, I would
see every man of you damned before I would
raise my arm against the flag.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The expression
is not exactly in consonance with Farragut&#8217;s
calm and restrained nature, but it fits so well
with his later one from the shrouds of the <i>Hartford</i>
in Mobile Bay, that it may be taken as
true. In any case, Farragut left Norfolk on
April 18th, with his wife and son, Loyall. He
found Baltimore, on his arrival there in the Bay
Line steamer, in possession of the mob which had
attacked the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment
passing through that morning, April 19th. He
went to Hastings-on-the-Hudson and awaited
orders.</p>

<p>Every Southern officer was then suspected,
and it required Porter&#8217;s utmost powers to convince
the Secretary of the Navy that Farragut
was the man for the great effort which was to
be made. On Porter&#8217;s going to Hastings, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
found Farragut thoroughly in accord with the
plan and eager for the work. He reached
Washington on December 12, 1861, and on
January 9, 1862, was appointed commander-in-chief
of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron,
with his flag in the <i>Hartford</i>, a sister ship to the
<i>Brooklyn</i>, each carrying twenty-two 9-inch
smooth-bore guns and two 20-pounder rifles.
It is far from the least of Porter&#8217;s services to
his country that he should have been the instrument
of this selection.</p>

<p>We all know the story of the passage of the
forts by the fleet (numbering seventeen ships,
with 179 guns) with the rising of the moon, early
in the morning of April 24, 1862; of the fire rafts
(one of which set the <i>Hartford</i> afire); of the fight
with the eleven Confederate steamers (one an
ironclad ram) above the forts; the arrival off
New Orleans. Says George W. Cable: &#8220;I went
to the riverside; there far into the night I saw
hundreds of drays carrying cotton out of the
presses and yards to the wharves, where it was
fired. The glare of these sinuous miles of flame
set men and women weeping and wailing thirty
miles away on the farther shore of Lake Pontchartrain.
But the next day was a day of terrors....
The firemen were out, but they cast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
fire upon the waters, putting the torch to the
empty ships and cutting them loose to float
down the river. Whoever could go was going....
My employer left the city. I
closed the doors and ran to the river to see the
sights.... &#8216;Are the Yankee ships in
sight?&#8217; I asked an idler. He pointed to the
tops of their naked masts as they showed up
across the huge bend of the river. They were
engaging the batteries at Camp Chalmette&mdash;the
old field of Jackson&#8217;s renown. Presently
that was over. Ah me! I see them now as
they came slowly round Slaughter House Point
into full view, silent, so grim and terrible, black
with men, heavy with deadly portent, the long-banished
Stars and Stripes flying against the
frowning sky. Oh, for the <i>Mississippi</i>, the <i>Mississippi</i>!
Just then she came down upon them.
But now drifting helplessly&mdash;a mass of flames.</p>

<p>&#8220;The crowds on the levee howled and
screamed with rage. The swarming decks answered
never a word; but one old tar on the <i>Hartford</i>,
standing with a lanyard in his hand beside
a great pivot gun, so plain in view you could see
him smile, silently patted its big black breech
and blandly grinned.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>The ships anchored, and now came as bold an
act as any of these stirring hours. Captain
Theodorus Bailey, Farragut&#8217;s flag captain, and
Lieutenant George Perkins, of beloved memory
in the navy, landed and calmly walked through
a howling mob crying &#8220;Hang them! hang them!&#8221;
to the city hall and demanded the hauling down
of the state flag and surrender of the city.</p>

<p>It was not until the 28th that everything was
settled by the surrender of the forts to Commander
Porter, who had remained below with
his mortar flotilla, which had done such good
service. Mention should be made of the very
improper action of the British ship <i>Mersey</i>,
which, following Farragut&#8217;s fleet up the river,
anchored near the <i>Hartford</i>, where the men
aboard sang Confederate songs and acted
otherwise in a way so offensive that Farragut
was obliged to call the English captain&#8217;s attention
to their conduct. Farragut should, in
fact, have ordered the ship out of the river.</p>

<p>The first step only had been taken. There
were yet to come great and ever-memorable
battles before Port Hudson and Vicksburg;
fights with ironclads, and expeditions up the
rivers by squadrons of improvised men-of-war
under Flag Officers Davis and Foote, both of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
gallant memory. Finally the command of the
navy, extending over the whole of the vast river
system of which the Mississippi was the main
artery, fell gradually to Porter, who on the fall of
Vicksburg, in which his fleet played so great a
part, was made a rear-admiral. His command
was now extended down to New Orleans. He
had over 150 vessels under his flag, and on
August 7, 1863, he was able to write from New
Orleans that the &#8220;river is entirely free from
guerrillas, and merchant vessels can travel it
without danger.&#8221; But there was plenty of
fighting yet for the navy in the affluents of the
Mississippi, and the Red River expedition of
March 12 to May 16, 1864, in aid of General
Banks&#8217;s ill-advised campaign, came near to
causing the destruction of the most important
part of Porter&#8217;s fleet through the falling of the
water. The building of the famous dam by
Colonel Bailey of the volunteers, and the successful
passage thereby of the fleet into deeper
water, is one of the great dramatic events of the
war.</p>

<p>While such things were happening on the
western rivers, scores of actions were taking
place in Atlantic waters. The siege of Charleston
was a continuous operation and was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
remain such to the end of the war; the ironclad
had come into extended use; the Confederate
ironclad <i>Atlanta</i> had been captured in Wassaw
Sound in Georgia by the monitor <i>Weehawken</i>,
under Captain John Rodgers. There were in all,
during the year 1863, 145 engagements by the
navy, great and small.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The year 1864 was to bring the Civil War
well toward a close. The blockade had become
one of extreme rigor; the region west of the Mississippi
had been entirely cut off, and the whole
South was now reduced to a poverty of arms,
equipment, food, clothing, and medical supplies,
the want of all of which was gradually reducing
its armies to a state of inanition. Before the
end of the war every port had been closed,
Wilmington, in North Carolina, being the last.
Between November, 1861, and March, 1864,
eighty-four different steamers were running
between Nassau and Confederate ports, of
which thirty-seven were captured and twenty-four
wrecked or otherwise destroyed.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> These
vessels were built in Great Britain especially for
the service, were laden with British cargoes, and
used the British Bahamas and Bermudas as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
ports of call and supply. Nassau bloomed into
one of the greatest and most active ports of the
world.</p>

<p>In addition to the remarkable episode of Red
River already mentioned, which resulted in
saving Porter&#8217;s fleet, the last year of the war was
to include some of its most important and
striking events: the appearance in April of the
powerful ironclad <i>Albemarle</i>; her career, and her
final destruction by a torpedo through the heroic
bravery of Lieutenant Cushing on the night of
October 27-28; the fight of the <i>Kearsarge</i> and
<i>Alabama</i> on June 19th; the battle of Mobile Bay
on August 5th; the appearance of the ironclad
<i>Stonewall</i> and the bombardments of Fort Fisher
at the end of December and in the beginning of
the new year.</p>

<p>The destruction of the <i>Alabama</i> on a Sunday
morning off Cherbourg brought to an end the
career of a ship built in England and manned
by an English crew, which for more than two
years had sunk or burned our merchantmen.
Her captain escaped being taken, as the English
yacht <i>Deerhound</i>, which had accompanied the
<i>Alabama</i> out of the harbor to the point seven
miles out where the <i>Kearsarge</i> awaited her, took
him aboard before he could be reached by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
boats from the <i>Kearsarge</i>. That this aid, if it
should be necessary, was prearranged, is shown
by the statement of Winslow of the <i>Kearsarge</i>,
that the <i>Deerhound</i> had received aboard Captain
Semmes&#8217;s valuables the night before. It was a
notable victory and went far to set aright the
British mind, so susceptible to &#8220;success.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mobile, which so soon followed, was the
crown of Farragut&#8217;s career, and fixes his place
as the greatest of naval commanders. His daring,
his consummate decision, his perfect self-reliance
in situations such as never before fell to
an admiral to face, and his thorough command of
such, justify every praise. And in character&mdash;simplicity,
kindliness, and uprightness, and in
every quality which we are apt to assign to the
best breeding of the sea&mdash;he was among the very
first. Of but one other, so far as I have known
men, can so much be said&mdash;Sampson his successor
of thirty-three years after.</p>

<p>Farragut&#8217;s climbing aloft in the main shrouds,
where his flag-lieutenant, John Crittenden
Watson (who still survives him, an honored
admiral), lashed him to prevent his falling; his
anger with the slowing of the <i>Brooklyn</i> when her
captain saw the monitor <i>Tecumseh</i> go down
before him from the explosion of a mine; Farragut&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
order, shouted from aloft: &#8220;Damn the
torpedoes. Full speed ahead!&#8221;; the more than
Sydneyan courtesy of Tunis Craven, the captain
of the unfortunate <i>Tecumseh</i>, in stepping aside
from the port of the turret and saying to the
pilot: &#8220;After you, sir,&#8221; and going down with his
ship; the final magnificent grappling of the
<i>Hartford</i>, <i>Monongahela</i>, and <i>Lackawanna</i> with
the ironclad <i>Tennessee</i>, make a story which it
needs a poet to tell and which should be enshrined
in the heart of every lover of complete
courage and genius in action, and in no man
were these more personified than in Farragut.
America would seem to have lost that genius for
praise in poetry of her heroes and heroic actions
which has remained in full vigor in England,
whose poets seem to rise ever to the occasion,
even if at times soaring somewhat above it.
But better the latter than none at all. Still,
whether sung or not (for Brownell&#8217;s fine poem
was but a taste of what should be), Mobile Bay
remains one of the finest dramas ever enacted
upon the salt flood of ocean.</p>

<p>The great bombardments of Fort Fisher on
December 24th, 25th, and 27th, and again on
January 11th-15th by the fleet of fifty-eight ships
under Admiral Porter, during which the fort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
was assaulted by 2,000 seamen and marines
which, though unsuccessful in itself, greatly
assisted that of the army, were the last naval
events of high importance of the war. During
this bombardment, in which the most powerful
ships of the navy assisted, 16,682 projectiles
were fired, weighing 1,652,638 pounds. All of
the nineteen guns on the sea face of the fort
were dismounted.</p>

<p>On April 9th came the surrender of Lee at
Appomattox, and peace.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> end of the &#8220;Brothers&#8217; War&#8221; had made of
the United States a nation. Our country took
its place in the world, and its fleets again reached
into every sea. But the lessons of the navy had
not touched the dull minds which in June, 1860,
had voted down the supplies of the little navy
which was to expand so greatly in the four succeeding
years. To such, the whole work of defeating
the Confederacy appeared to be the more
spectacular work of the army. The constriction
of the blockade was not of the dramatic
character of Gettysburg or the battles of the
Wilderness. Its meaning was to filter but slowly
into even the more thoughtful. Thus for years,
while immense changes were going on elsewhere,
we were at a standstill in naval matters,
or rather slowly sinking to absolute nonentity.
By 1882 the shameful condition of neglect began
to be remedied. That year may be taken as
the birth-year of our navy of to-day. For seven
years we had to go abroad for such material&mdash;gun-forgings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
shafting, and armor&mdash;as we wanted,
until our naval demands forced upon our steel
establishments the work of putting themselves
in order. The story of this work has never been
told, but the country can be assured that it was
to the navy that the initial great development
of steel manufacture in this country was due.
In 1882 we could make only a forged iron shaft
for the little <i>Dolphin</i>, which promptly broke on
her trial trip. It was through arrangements
made by the Navy Department that our steel
works, beginning with Bethlehem, established
modern conditions.</p>

<p>The story of the building of the new navy is
outside the scope of this book. It suffices to
say that by 1898 we had in service four battleships,
the <i>Iowa</i>, <i>Indiana</i>, <i>Oregon</i>, and <i>Massachusetts</i>,
of the first class; the <i>Texas</i>, of the second;
two armored cruisers, the <i>New York</i> and <i>Brooklyn</i>;
eleven protected cruisers of from 3,000 to
7,735 tons, and twenty unprotected cruisers
of from 839 to 2,089 tons. We also had eight
torpedo boats, a dynamite vessel, the <i>Vesuvius</i>,
and six ships of the monitor type, from 4,000
to 6,060 tons. It was with this fleet we fought
the war with Spain.</p>

<p>The causes of this war stretch back through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
generations. Their foundation was, essentially,
a difference in race. The American is mainly
an Anglo-Saxon, direct and practical in his
way; the Spaniard an oriental, courteous, kindly
in the relations of friendship and family, with
much that is lovable, but impracticable, tribal
in his tendencies, knowing little of the modern
phases of government by a constitution, and
bloodthirsty and devastating in putting down
revolt or in settling political differences. An
anarchic century in Spain produced like conditions
in Cuba. Our proximity to Cuba and
our many commercial interests there were very
strong elements in the situation.</p>

<p>A great impetus was given to feeling for Cuba
and against Spain by the explosion of the
<i>Maine</i> in Havana Harbor about 9:30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
February 15th. Two months, however, were
yet to pass before war was declared, though
at the last moment Spain had acceded to all our
demands. While our diplomacy may thus be said
to have been not entirely &#8220;correct,&#8221; President
McKinley may be ruled to have been wise in
cutting the Gordian knot by war, which his message
of April 11, 1898, practically did in referring
the whole subject to Congress. The joint
resolution passed and signed on April 20th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
demanding that Spain should relinquish her
authority in Cuba, was of course taken as a
declaration of war by Spain, and April 21st was
declared by Congress a few days later as the
official date of its beginning.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of May 21st Captain William
T. Sampson, who was now in command of
the North Atlantic station, and was with the
flagship <i>New York</i> off the reef at Key West
where well-nigh all the available ships in the
Atlantic were collected, received a telegram
announcing his assignment to the command,
with the rank of rear-admiral, an advancement
only possible by selection by the President in
time of war. This was the first indication of
actual hostilities, but it was soon followed by
another ordering to blockade immediately the
coast of Cuba from Cardenas to Bahia Honda
(a little west of Havana). Gathering during
the night outside the reef (distant six miles from
Key West) all the ships ready to move, the fleet
early next morning was on its way, and by evening
was off Havana, the searchlights of which
were sweeping the sea in expectancy of the
American fleet. Powerfully armed as were its
batteries, they were, curiously enough, so disposed
that they were open to attack from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
southwest, with little possibility of return. It
was Sampson&#8217;s eager wish to make this attack
at once, and a battle-order had been drawn in
anticipation of war, early in April, but the Navy
Department in a letter of April 6th set its face
so decidedly against the attempt, that Sampson
had to yield. The department from the view
of the necessity of preserving the fleet to meet
Cervera was justified, but Sampson&#8217;s view, as
later analysis of the situation showed, was correct.
Had action been allowed, Havana would
have been ours, without loss, on April 23d.</p>

<p>In addition to Sampson&#8217;s command, a squadron
made up of the <i>Brooklyn</i>, <i>Massachusetts</i>, and
<i>Texas</i> was stationed at Hampton Roads under
Commodore Schley; and several others, among
them the fast <i>Columbia</i> and <i>Minneapolis</i> and
the cruiser <i>San Francisco</i>, were kept north to
meet the clamor of the seacoast in general for
protection. The public could not understand
that the only real protection was concentration
against, and the destruction of, the enemy&#8217;s
fleet.</p>

<p>As the joint resolution of Congress of April
20th declared the aim of the United States to be
relinquishment of Spanish authority in the island
of Cuba, our main sphere of action was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
naturally the Caribbean. As soon as Spain
should have yielded the island, the war would
naturally end unless Spain should choose to continue
it. There were in the island, by official
statement, 159,297 regular troops and 119,160
volunteers. The American regular army, distributed
from Maine to Alaska, was but 28,183.
Of course it was necessary to call for a large
number of volunteers.</p>

<p>To preserve Cuba it was necessary for Spain
to preserve communication with the island.
This could be done only by obtaining and keeping
command of the Atlantic. To do this she
had an effective force of only four armored
cruisers: the <i>Infanta Maria Teresa</i>, <i>Almirante
Oquendo</i>, <i>Vizcaya</i> (Biscay), and <i>Crist&oacute;bal Col&oacute;n</i>,
each of about 7,000 tons. A battleship, the
<i>Pelayo</i>, and a large armored cruiser, the <i>Carlos
V</i>, were not yet ready for service. This was of
course a hopeless disparity of fighting force as
compared with Admiral Sampson&#8217;s fleet of five
powerful battleships and two armored cruisers.
Admiral Cervera, who had been placed in command
of the Spanish squadron, saw this clearly
and protested, without avail, against sending it
across the Atlantic. On April 29, 1898, he
left the Cape Verde Islands with the four armored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
cruisers first mentioned and with three
torpedo-boat destroyers, with orders to go to
San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Commodore George Dewey, commanding our
naval forces in Asia, had, under the orders of the
department, collected his whole force at Hong
Kong in anticipation of the war, and had made
ready for the eventuality. The <i>Baltimore</i>, a
large cruiser for the period, had fortunately
reached him in time with a precious supply of
extra ammunition. The British Declaration of
Neutrality had obliged him to withdraw on
April 24th his force consisting of the <i>Olympia</i>,
<i>Baltimore</i>, <i>Boston</i>, <i>Raleigh</i>, <i>Concord</i>, <i>Petrel</i>, and
the revenue cutter <i>McCulloch</i>, from Hong Kong
to Mirs Bay, thirty miles away on the China
coast. Here, on April 26th, he received a telegram
informing him officially of the declaration
of war and adding: &#8220;Commence operations at
once, particularly against the Spanish fleet.
You must capture vessels or destroy. Use utmost
endeavors.&#8221; The last three words were
certainly unnecessary. He left as soon as possible,
this being the afternoon of May 27th. It
was 620 miles to Manila.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the outlook for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Spanish at Manila was not cheerful. They had
but two vessels of any considerable size, the
<i>Reina Cristina</i> and the <i>Castilla</i>, of 3,100 and
3,300 tons, and the latter, which had been in use
as a receiving ship, had no motive power. In
addition there were available two small cruisers
of 1,152 tons, two of 1,040, and a gunboat of
500. Three other small vessels, one the <i>Velasco</i>,
of 1,139 tons, were under repairs, with some of
their guns in the batteries at the entrance of the
bay, twenty-five miles away. Dewey had the
<i>Olympia</i>, of 5,870 tons; <i>Baltimore</i>, 4,413;
<i>Raleigh</i>, 3,183; <i>Boston</i>, 3,000; <i>Concord</i>, 1,710;
and <i>Petrel</i>, 892. The guns, besides a number of
3 and 6 pounders, were:</p>

</table>

<p>The complements of the two squadrons were:
American, 1,707 men; Spanish, 1,664.</p>

<p>It was a ten-mile stretch across the entrance
to the bay, divided into two deep channels by
islands upon which had been hastily established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
batteries mounted with seventeen guns varying
in calibre from 7 to 4.3 inch; nine of these were
muzzle-loaders and thus could not be fired
nearly so rapidly as the 4.3-inch, which were
quick-firers. At Manila were mounted 226
guns of all kinds, most of which were inefficient;
but there were twelve good breech-loaders of
from 9.45-inch to 4.7-inch, with much less range,
however, than the modern 8-inch carried by the
<i>Olympia</i>. The Manila defences, however, were
such that it would have been much wiser for
Montojo to have anchored close as possible to
the fortifications and thus obtain such support
as was available. As it was, he was out of their
protection, supported by only eight guns, mostly
ineffective weapons, in battery at Sangley Point
and Cavite; three of these, two 6.3-inch and one
4.7-inch, were of value.</p>

<p>Dewey was off Subig Bay on Saturday, April
30th. After examining the bay for the Spanish
ships he stood for Manila, fifty-seven miles
away. At midnight he passed the rock El
Fraile in Boca Grande, the battery on which
fired upon the squadron, which answered with a
few shots. At five o&#8217;clock the squadron was
near the mouth of the river, on both sides of
which Manila is built, when the Spanish squadron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
was sighted at anchor off Cavite, six miles
to the southward, and our ships at once turned
in that direction. Fire was opened at 5:41
by the <i>Olympia</i>. The American squadron stood
down slowly to the westward, turned and turned
again, passing thus five times before the anchored
Spanish ships, thrice to the west, twice
to the east. After an action of two hours, on a
report of shortness of ammunition (which proved
incorrect) the squadron hauled off for a count
of its supply and to give the men breakfast, the
captains being called aboard to report damages.
None of these were serious, and no men had
been killed, though several were wounded.
During this time the Spanish squadron was seen
to be in flames, and the American squadron
then stood in and completed its work. The
victory was complete. The Americans had
fired in all 5,859 shots, 1,414 of which were 5,
6, and 8 inch; there remained 2,861 of the
heavier shell and over 30,000 of the 6, 3, and 1
pounders.</p>

<p>The result of the action depended upon gunnery
efficiency, as there was no ship on either
side which was not thoroughly vulnerable to
the guns used. And though our gunnery was
(as also at Santiago) far below the present high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
standard, the result was positive proof of great
superiority to that of the Spanish.</p>

<p>The Americans had two officers and six men
wounded in the <i>Baltimore</i>. Otherwise they
were scathless. The Spanish loss, as reckoned
by &#8220;painstaking inquiry&#8221; by an American officer,
was 167 killed and 214 wounded. Admiral
Montojo&#8217;s own statement, which puts his
whole force at but 1,134, was 75 killed and
281 wounded.</p>

<p>Dewey cut and buoyed the cable on May 2d,
took position in the bay, and awaited the coming
of troops which were soon to be on their
way. He sent the revenue cutter <i>McCulloch</i>,
which had taken no part in the action, to telegraph
his victory home. Before he had cut the
cable, however, the news had been telegraphed
to Madrid, and it was thence received on May
2d with great enthusiasm in the United States.
On May 10th Dewey received the thanks of
Congress and was raised to the rank of Admiral
of the Navy.</p>

<p>While the victory was to have great results in
determining our attitude toward the Philippines,
it could in no sense determine the result
of the war; this could only be attained by the
destruction of one or the other battle fleets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
now in the Atlantic. The event, however, put
a very different complexion upon the attitude
of Europe. There was to be no further European
talk of putting limitations upon our conduct
of the struggle.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Naval</span> action now shifts almost entirely to
the Caribbean. Until in the last days of the
war there was to be in the Pacific no further
special naval movement beyond the seizure
of Guam by the <i>Charleston</i> on June 11th and
the sending to Manila the monitors <i>Monterey</i>
and <i>Monadnock</i> to reinforce Dewey. The first
of the army sailed from San Francisco on May
28th.</p>

<p>The departure of Cervera from the Cape
Verdes caused Admiral Sampson to move from
Havana east 970 miles to San Juan, Puerto
Rico, with the expectancy of finding there the
Spanish fleet. This move was based upon the
view that as it was but from 1,200 to 1,400 miles
from San Juan to important points on our coast,
it was an absolute necessity to make sure that
if the Spanish squadron arrived there it should
not be allowed to leave and be free to raid our
seaboard. Sampson&#8217;s prescience was right.
Cervera&#8217;s orders were to go there and then do as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
he thought best. Had he not himself been so
slow in crossing the Atlantic, Sampson would
have found him at San Juan, and the Spanish
fleet would have been destroyed on May 12th
instead of July 3d.</p>

<p>Continuous breakdowns of the two monitors
accompanying Sampson caused such delay that
his squadron was not off San Juan until May
12th. An attack on the fortifications began at
5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and continued for three hours, when
Sampson withdrew with no damage to the ships
and with the loss of one man killed and four
wounded aboard the <i>New York</i>. As Cervera
was clearly not in port, and as it was necessary
not to risk overmuch the American ships before
he could be met, it was thought inadvisable
to continue the action, though as known later
the place was ready to surrender to another
attack. As Cervera was much overdue and
no word had as yet been received of his whereabouts,
the American squadron stood west (with
a view to covering Havana), sending into St.
Thomas, only sixty miles to the east, for news.</p>

<p>It was not until in the early morning of May
15th, off Puerto Plata, that word came of Cervera&#8217;s
having reached Cura&ccedil;ao. At the same
time a dispatch from Washington was received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
by Sampson informing him that the Flying
Squadron was en route to Key West and directing
Sampson himself to proceed there with all
possible dispatch.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cervera had arrived off Martinique on the
evening of May 11th and had sent in a destroyer
for news, which brought next morning the word
of Sampson&#8217;s being off Puerto Rico. Unable
now to go to San Juan without meeting the
American fleet, a council of war was called, and
on its decision Cervera shaped his course for
Cura&ccedil;ao in search of coal, leaving the destroyer
<i>Terror</i>, whose boilers had given out, at Martinique.
Leaving Cura&ccedil;ao in the evening of May
15th, he entered the harbor of Santiago de Cuba
at dawn on May 19th.</p>

<p>Sampson was now, as mentioned, standing at
full speed for Key West. It is very remarkable
that he had the same instinct as to Cervera&#8217;s
second destination as to his first; as in a telegram
to the scout <i>Harvard</i> (the <i>New York</i> of the
American line of steamers) he mentioned Santiago
or San Juan as the ports likely to be entered.
The peremptory orders from Washington left no
freedom of action, however, and on May 18th
Key West was reached. There were found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
ships of the Flying Squadron, the <i>Brooklyn</i>,
<i>Massachusetts</i>, and <i>Texas</i>, just arrived from
Hampton Roads and coaling.</p>

<p>On May 11th, the day before Sampson&#8217;s attack
at San Juan, there were two affairs of great
gallantry: the one the cable-cutting at Cienfuegos;
the other an action at Cardenas. The
former was carried out by two sailing launches
for lifting and cutting the cables and two steam
launches carrying marines to &#8220;stand off&#8221; the
Spaniards. The <i>Marblehead</i> and <i>Nashville</i> kept
up a fire against the forces entrenched on the
edge of the low bluff which finally had to be
approached within 150 feet before the work was
accomplished. Grappling for the cables was
long and tedious, and the operation of sawing
through each took nearly half an hour. To perform
such work under a constant fire from the
Spaniards in trenches not more than 200 yards
away showed a cool courage of which Americans
can be proud. The boats were back to their
ships in a little over three hours, with two killed
and seven wounded, one of the latter being
Lieutenant Winslow in command.</p>

<p>The action on the same day at Cardenas on
the north side of Cuba, but seventy-five miles
from Cienfuegos by land, but 500 by sea, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
between the <i>Wilmington</i>, the <i>Machias</i>, the
revenue cutter <i>Hudson</i>, and the torpedo boat
<i>Winslow</i> against three Spanish gunboats which
lay well within the harbor in water which could
not be entered by our heavier draft vessels.
The torpedo boat, which of course was never
intended for such service, ventured in too far
and was severely handled. Ensign Bagley
and four of the men were killed, and three,
one being Lieutenant Bernadou in command,
were wounded. The <i>Winslow</i>, wholly disabled,
was towed out of her dangerous position by the
intrepid handling of the <i>Hudson</i>.</p>

<p>We return to Key West, where all was movement
to take measures to intercept Cervera.</p>

<p>The Navy Department had become convinced
from information received that Cervera had
imperative orders to go either to Cienfuegos or
Havana to land material necessary for the defence
of Havana, and urged the utmost dispatch
in blockading both ports. Thus next morning,
May 19th, Commodore Schley sailed with the
three ships of his squadron mentioned, to be
followed next day by the <i>Iowa</i>, our newest battleship
of the time, and which reached Cienfuegos
only seven hours after Commodore Schley.
There followed the torpedo boat <i>Dupont</i>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
collier <i>Merrimac</i>, the cruisers <i>Marblehead</i>, <i>Castine</i>,
and two auxiliary vessels; an ample force,
should Cervera be met.</p>

<p>Events were now following one another with
the utmost rapidity. To deal with these in
detail is quite beyond our scope. One must look
to the larger histories of the war for the full
account of the happenings of this stirring time.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
One can give here but a running mention of the
reception on the late afternoon of May 19th of
the news by the way of Havana of Cervera&#8217;s
arrival that morning at Santiago de Cuba; the
repetition of this news with an expression of
doubt in the telegram from Washington to
Sampson during that night; its verification next
day, the 20th; the dispatch of the news to Schley
with orders, if convinced that Cervera was not
in Cienfuegos Bay,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> to go to Santiago and
blockade; Sampson&#8217;s movement 300 miles east
with the rest of the fleet available into the narrow
waters of Nicholas Channel, to intercept
Cervera should he leave Santiago and attempt
to reach Havana; the delay of Schley at Cienfuegos,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
not being satisfied that Cervera was not
there; the final assurance that Cervera was not
at Cienfuegos received from insurgents on May
24th, and the departure that evening of Commodore
Schley&#8217;s squadron for Santiago; his
arrival twenty-two miles south of the entrance
on May 26th; Cervera&#8217;s intention (but given
up through vacillation) to leave Santiago that
evening at almost the same moment when
Schley started with intention to return to Key
West on the plea of inability to coal his
ships; his change of mind on May 28th and
arrival that evening off Santiago; the arrival of
the <i>Oregon</i> at Key West on May 26th, completing
her remarkable journey of 14,000 miles from
the west coast; Sampson&#8217;s finally determining
to go to Santiago on account of Schley&#8217;s dispatch
that he could not blockade for want of coal; the
recognition of the <i>Col&oacute;n</i> in the harbor entrance
on May 29th; the ineffectual attack on the
<i>Col&oacute;n</i> on May 30th; the arrival of Sampson on
June 1st with the <i>New York</i>, <i>Oregon</i>, <i>Mayflower</i>,
and torpedo boat <i>Porter</i>; the establishment of a
close blockade; the sinking of the <i>Merrimac</i> in
the entrance channel; the stationing every
evening of a battleship with searchlights upon
the harbor entrance; the occupancy of Guant&aacute;namo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Bay; the driving off, by the battalion of
marines established there in camp, of the Spanish
troops in the vicinity; the frequent bombardment
of the Spanish batteries at Santiago
entrance; the arrival on June 20th of the army
under General Shafter; its debarkation and
movement against Santiago; the attack of July
1st on El Caney and San Juan Hill; the sortie
of Cervera&#8217;s squadron; its destruction: these
are but the chief events of the many which happened
between May 18th and July 3d. On the
forenoon of Sunday, this latter date, was decided
the fate of Spain in America.</p>

<p>More than half the crews of the Spanish ships
had been used ashore on July 1st in the defence
of Santiago, and the commander of these, Captain
Bustamante, Cervera&#8217;s chief-of-staff, had,
to the great grief of all who knew him both in
the Spanish and American services, been mortally
wounded. Cervera had, after the battle
of July 1st, received orders to leave the harbor
and endeavor to save his squadron. He and his
captains accepted the situation with calm courage
and prepared to leave the evening of July
2d. The slow work of returning the crews
aboard ship caused delay until the next morning.</p>

<p>At 9:30 the crews of the American ships were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
just falling in for the usual Sunday &#8220;inspection.&#8221;
The admiral had started a little before
nine in the <i>New York</i> under easy steam to arrange
with General Shafter a plan of combined
attack. The <i>New York</i> had gone about five
miles when a shot was heard from the battery
at the entrance and a ship almost immediately
after seen coming out. The <i>New York</i> at once
turned.</p>

<p>In accord with the admiral&#8217;s standing order,
all the ships immediately started to close in
on the entrance. The flagship <i>Infanta Maria
Teresa</i>, which was the ship first sighted, was
naturally exposed for some little time to the
fire of all, and was quickly a mass of flames and
heading in for the land. She was run ashore
about six miles west of the harbor entrance;
the <i>Oquendo</i>, though she was the last of the
large ships to come out, was beached, also burning,
soon after the <i>Maria Teresa</i>, about a quarter
of a mile west of the latter; the <i>Vizcaya</i>, afire,
went on to the reef fifteen miles west of Santiago
about 11:30, shortly after which her forward
magazine exploded. The destroyer <i>Furor</i>
had been sunk, and the <i>Pluton</i> was ashore
destroyed, having made only three miles to the
west. The <i>Col&oacute;n</i> only was left, in full flight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
and practically uninjured, pursued by the <i>Oregon</i>,
<i>Brooklyn</i>, <i>New York</i>, and <i>Texas</i>. At 1:15
she turned ashore, the 13-inch shell of the <i>Oregon</i>,
fired at 9,000 yards, going over her. Her
sea-valves had been opened, and though she
was pushed on to the beach stern foremost by the
<i>New York</i>, her bow overhung into deep water
and as she filled she turned on her side. She was
never raised. The heroic efforts of the American
crews in saving life from the burning ships
are deserving every praise.</p>

<p>The Spanish loss may be taken as about 264
killed and drowned and 151 wounded; the
prisoners, including officers, numbered 1,813.
The Americans lost 1 killed, 1 wounded, both
in the <i>Brooklyn</i>.</p>

<p>The Spanish could not have expected to escape,
nor did they. They went to their death
like heroes. There has been nothing finer than
the calm bravery of their exit from the narrow
harbor entrance without accident or delay on
the part of any ship. We had against them six
heavy ships to four; fourteen 12-inch and 13-inch
guns against six 11-inch; thirty 8-inch
against none of that calibre; forty-four 6, 5, and
4 inch against thirty-six 5.5 and 4.7 inch, and
ninety-six 6-pounders against thirty-eight Spanish.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
We had a like superiority in armor. In
one point, speed, the Spanish were, nominally
at least, decidedly superior, all their ships
being of twenty knots. Only two of the
Americans: the <i>New York</i> and <i>Brooklyn</i>, had
such.</p>

<p>There remained now only the question of
reducing the city of Santiago, in which the navy
took an active part in bombardment of the city
from the sea. On July 17th it surrendered.</p>

<p>The success of the navy at Santiago was due
to the circular blockade instituted by Admiral
Sampson on his arrival, and to the lighting up
the harbor entrance nightly with the searchlights
of the battleships, which were relieved
every two hours. Escape at night was thus, by
Cervera&#8217;s own report, made impossible. The
circular form of Sampson&#8217;s blockade during the
day and night left no such chance of finding an
extensive unguarded space, such as existed in
steaming in column to and fro across the entrance.
The whole is summed up in the report
of Captain (now Rear-Admiral) Clark of the
<i>Oregon</i> to Admiral Sampson: &#8220;We went ahead
at full speed with the determination of carrying
out to the utmost your order: &#8216;If the enemy
tries to escape, the ships must close and engage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
as soon as possible and endeavor to sink his vessels
or force them to run ashore.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With their only battle fleet destroyed, the
preservation by the Spanish of communication
with Cuba was now impossible and the fall of
the island certain. Thus an expedition under
the command of Admiral C&aacute;mara left Cadiz on
June 17th for the Philippines. It reached Port
Said on June 25th. A strong force was detailed
from Admiral Sampson&#8217;s fleet to go to the Philippines
under Commodore Watson, to be accompanied
through the Mediterranean by the
rest of the available ships of the fleet under
Sampson himself. The news of the 3d of July,
and also of the preparation of this fleet, caused
Spain to recall C&aacute;mara&#8217;s force before it had left
the vicinity of Suez. Meanwhile a large number
of ships had taken a prominent part in the
convoying of part of General Miles&#8217;s force to
Puerto Rico and in the seizure of the south
coast of that island.</p>

<p>Spain, with full recognition of the meaning of
her loss, opened negotiations for peace, and on
August 12, 1898, the protocol was signed by
which she relinquished all sovereignty over
Cuba, ceded to the United States Puerto Rico<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
and an island in the Ladrones to be selected,
and agreed to our occupancy of the city of
Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty of
peace which would determine the future of the
Philippines.</p>

<p>At the moment of the signing of the protocol
our fleet and troops were preparing for the assault
at Manila. By noon the city had surrendered
and was in our possession. The date
at Manila, owing to difference in time, was
August 13th. Thus there were but a few hours
between the surrender and the signing, but the
latter had preceded the surrender and Manila
could not be claimed as ours by right of conquest.
Although the claim was put forward, it
was soon withdrawn, and we now possess the
archipelago by right of purchase, though indeed
it must be said that the sale by Spain was an
enforced one. The war thus ended with Puerto
Rico and Guam as possessions by conquest,
with the Hawaiian Islands a United States
territory by annexation, with Cuba a protectorate,
and the Philippines a purchased possession.
We had gone far afield and had incurred
heavy responsibilities which stretched eight
thousand miles westward from California, and
had taken up a naval base adjacent to what is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
sure to be one of the great fields of future world
action&mdash;Eastern Asia.</p>

<p>It is difficult to leave the subject of the Philippines
without a word as to the continuation
of naval action among the islands and the share
taken by the navy in the release of Spaniards
held by the natives, in frequent punitive expeditions,
and in the general pacification of the
region. For several years our ships were active
equally with the army in this work. In February,
1899, the important point of Ilo-Ilo was
bombarded and captured by the small cruiser
<i>Petrel</i>. Constant work of patrol and blockade
was carried out, not always without loss.
Throughout there was active co&ouml;peration with
the army in transporting troops and in attack
and defence, with for some years separate expeditions
by the marines of great hardship and
courage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> losses of the navy in the war with Spain
were extraordinarily small. There were but
sixteen killed and sixty-eight wounded, of
whom two died later. But even more remarkable,
and it reflects the highest praise upon the
service, was the state of health of the 26,102
men during this war of 114 days (April 21st to
August 12th, inclusive). There were but fifty-six
deaths in this period from disease, or at the
rate of 6.85 per thousand a year. There were
but thirteen cases of typhoid fever, and no death
aboard ship from this disease and but one in
hospital. There were but eighteen cases of
dysentery. The marine battalion at Guant&aacute;namo
numbered 588&mdash;21 officers and 567 men.
There was no death from disease; only nineteen
cases of malaria and no typhoid.</p>

<p>The whole was a very remarkable showing;
one never equalled elsewhere. And it should be
remembered that it was in a climate, and indeed
very largely in the same region, where, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
century and a half before, the crews of some
British ships were so swept by disease that they
had in some cases to be renewed three times in
but a moderate period of service. The health
conditions of the American fleet showed an enlightened
care which reflects honor upon all
concerned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The situation left us by the Spanish War is one
which can be maintained only by a powerful
fleet, though our acquisitions in themselves
scarcely add to the necessity of such a fleet, for
meanwhile we have built the Panama Canal.
And while the canal has lightened our strategic
difficulties in that our battle fleet can now reach
San Francisco from the Caribbean in a fourth of
the time it took the <i>Oregon</i> to make her celebrated
passage from San Francisco to Key West,
there is upon us the heavy burden of the defence
of the isthmus, its position being in effect insular.
It can only remain in our hands by our
controlling the sea. Fortifications assist in its
defence for the time being, but should we go to
war it must finally go into the hands of the
power with a superior navy. And being thus
isolated and having this insular character, the
canal and its fortifications should be in naval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
control in order that there should be complete
unanimity of effort in its defence.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that however anti-imperialist
one may be, there is no American who would see
the canal go into foreign control with equanimity.
The most pronounced would halt at such
a danger. Thus whatever one&#8217;s attitude may
be toward the Monroe Doctrine, there are few
who would not uphold the contention that we
shall not permit any further extension of foreign
influence in the Caribbean or in any part of the
neighboring Pacific littoral, or in neighboring
islands such as the Galapagos. This is not
a question of extension of influence, but of
safety.</p>

<p>A word must be said as to the navy&#8217;s diplomatic
work. International law is mostly both
made and administered by navies. The navy
is thus a great and constant school of diplomacy,
the right hand of the Department of State. We
have had a notable instance, almost as I write, in
the events in Mexico, and from none have naval
officers received higher praise for their work
than from the late lamented Secretary of State,
John Hay. It is duty such as this which gives
the naval profession its breadth and importance
in peace, as great in its way, as in war. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
the diplomacy of naval officers is always in the
direction of peace, though it may sometimes be
peace with a strong hand, as in Admiral Benham&#8217;s
most admirable handling of the situation
in the harbor of Rio de Janeiro during the revolt
of 1895. He brought instantaneous peace between
the revolutionary forces and the Government;
he upheld international law, stood by
the rights of our merchant captains, and rendered
a service beyond price to Brazil.</p>

<p>Such international uses of the navy accentuate
the value of the Marine Corps, now a naval
army of 10,267 men and officers. Little has
been said heretofore in this book of this valuable,
indeed invaluable, force, as its duties are merged
largely in the general duties of the navy. It
differs from the army proper in its mobility and
ever-readiness for foreign service. Its mobility
is that of the navy itself; its transport is ever
ready; its supply train is the fleet.</p>

<p>It is an international understanding that seamen
or marines may be landed in any part of
the world for the protection of life and property,
and that such action may even extend to the use
of force without being regarded as an act of war.
There is no need to expand the value of such a
convention which gives the navy such an extension<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
of its field of forceful, and at the same
time peaceable, action.</p>

<p>We speak much of our development into a
world power through the war of 1898. We were
such a power potentially as soon as we had a
navy of a strength to enable us to say to another
power, &#8220;I forbid.&#8221; And we can only remain a
world power through a navy which can command
safety and peace. Linked to such power
there must be political good sense and just
dealing. Long habit in obedience and in command,
a life-long study of international relations,
a knowledge of the races of men such as
no other great profession can offer, an ideal
which puts duty as its first law; these enable
the navy to furnish its just quota of both the
high qualifications mentioned. To it the country
can securely trust its honor and safety. It
will ever do its duty.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A SHORT BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It would</span> take a great many pages to give a
complete bibliography of the subject of the
American navy. I must content myself with
mentioning only a few of the more prominent
works.</p>

<p>There were two navies: that of the Revolution,
which disappeared wholly in 1785; and that of
to-day, which had its origin in 1794. The two
most complete works regarding the former are
those of Gardner W. Allen, &#8220;A Naval History
of the Revolution,&#8221; 2 vols., Boston and New
York, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913, and
Oscar Charles Paullin, &#8220;The Navy of the American
Revolution: Its Administration, Its Policy,
and Its Achievements,&#8221; Cleveland, The Burrows
Brothers Company, 1906. This latter deals
chiefly with the legislative action respecting the
navy and its administration; it is the only one of
its class. To these two authors, Dr. Allen and
Dr. Paullin, I desire to express my special obligations.</p>

The good citizen is he or she who bears
an active hand in cleansing and making merry
the black spots of the neighborhood; who cherishes
a home however small; who takes an
increasingly intelligent interest in all that contributes
to the country&#8217;s welfare, and feels a
keenly patriotic hope for the future of the nation.</p>

<p>For such citizens <span class="allsmcap">THE AMERICAN BOOKS</span> are
designed&mdash;a series of small volumes on current
American problems. The keynote of the series
will be the discussion of distinctively American
movements and questions connected with the
future prosperity of the United States.</p>

<p>The series was planned long before the great
war, but it has derived added importance from
the position which that great struggle has given
America on the face of the globe. The United
States, standing aloof from the suicidal bloodshed
of the Old World, has necessarily become
the peaceful arbiter of the earth&#8217;s destinies and
the flywheel to keep the world&#8217;s industry revolving.</p>

<p>An inquiry into the meaning and tendency of
American civilization to-day is thus not only a
matter of interest but of patriotic duty. The
publishers wish <span class="allsmcap">THE AMERICAN BOOKS</span> to be a
series of brief, authoritative manuals which will
attempt to lay bare some of the problems that
confront us to-day; written in popular terms that
will inspire rather than discourage the casual
reader. The series should prove not only of
great interest to all American citizens who wish
to aid in solving their country&#8217;s pressing problems,
but to every foreigner visiting this country
who seeks an interpretation of the American
point of view.</p>

<p>The publishers wish <span class="allsmcap">THE AMERICAN BOOKS</span> to
be written by the best men, and to this end they
seek the widest publicity for the plan. They
will be glad to receive suggestions as to appropriate
titles for inclusion in the series and will
welcome authoritative MSS submitted from any
quarter. In particular they submit the plan to
the consideration of the American colleges where
the problems of the country are being studied.
In science, literature, business, politics, in the
arts of war and the arts of peace, the publishers
will seek writers who have stood for fearless
achievement or equally fearless failure, who will
build up <span class="smcap">A Library of Good Citizenship</span>.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
